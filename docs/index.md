# Vault Data Standard Cookbook

Welcome to the Autodesk Vault Data Standard Cookbook. This site distills the key automation hooks and scripting primitives from the official documentation into task-focused recipes for CAD administrators, solution consultants, and power users who extend Vault behavior.

## What you will find

- **Event walkthroughs** for the most common hooks (`OnPostCloseDialog`, `OnTabContextChanged`) that you can use to wire business rules directly into Data Standard dialogs.
- **Variable reference** tables that summarize the PowerShell helpers available inside Vault and CAD contexts.
- **Implementation checklists** that show how to bootstrap a Data Standard customization project safely.

## How to navigate

Use the left-hand navigation or the quick links below:

- [OnPostCloseDialog](events/onpostclosedialog.md)
- [OnTabContextChanged](events/ontabcontextchanged.md)
- [Data Standard PowerShell Variables](reference/data-standard-variables.md)
