# Vault Data Standard Cookbook

Welcome to the Autodesk Vault Data Standard Cookbook. This site distills the key automation hooks and scripting primitives from the official documentation into task-focused recipes for CAD administrators, solution consultants, and power users who extend Vault behavior.

## What you will find

- **Event walkthroughs** for the most common hooks (`OnPostCloseDialog`, `OnTabContextChanged`) that you can use to wire business rules directly into Data Standard dialogs.
- **Variable references** plus a copy-ready [PowerShell Pantry](reference/powershell-pantry.md) for the shared objects you will reuse.
- **Implementation checklists** that show how to bootstrap a Data Standard customization project safely.
- **Debugging and operations guides** covering the [Debugging Playbook](troubleshooting/debugging-playbook.md), Four-Eyes lifecycle controls, and support questionnaires reimagined as checklists.
- **Authoring templates** so every new recipe follows the same tone, front matter, and validation expectations.
