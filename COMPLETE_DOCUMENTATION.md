Explore the new capabilities and enhancements introduced in this release, which enhance workflow efficiencies.

# Copy Design - Property Editing

Unlock a more intelligent and streamlined design workflow with the Vault 2026.1 Update. This enhanced Copy Design feature now empowers users to edit key properties during the copying process, thereby eliminating the risk of missed updates and conserving valuable time. Whether one is duplicating a drawing, a complete design structure, or individual components, it is now possible to modify multiple properties simultaneously, utilizing intuitive copy/paste functionality or directly from Excel. Initiate your next design with confidence, precision, and efficiency right from the moment of copying.

Feature was inspired by suggestions from the [Vault Community Idea Board](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/vault-ideas/edit-properties-during-a-copy-design/idi-p/9644866).

# Copy Design – Numbering Scheme

Eliminate Renaming Headaches with Default Numbering Distribution

Vault 2026.1 streamlines the Copy Design process by enabling administrators to establish and disseminate a default numbering scheme for all users. This improvement guarantees consistency from the outset, thus averting expensive renaming tasks and diminishing errors that may arise from improper numbering or naming conventions. By standardizing the nomenclature of new designs, teams conserve time, remain aligned with corporate standards, and ensure that projects progress without disruption.

# Update Properties Enhancement

Vault 2026.1 eliminates the inconvenience associated with manual property updates through the introduction of a new, intelligent prompt during file check-out from the Vault client. When users initiate the check-out of a file within the Vault client, they are promptly reminded to update the mapped properties, thereby ensuring data synchronization without necessitating additional steps. This straightforward automation mitigates errors, conserves time, and maintains alignment between designs and Vault data. Though it represents a minor alteration, it possesses a substantial effect on overall productivity.

Feature was inspired by suggestions from the [Vault Community Idea Board](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/vault-ideas/vault-open-gt-update-properties/idi-p/5319005).

# Batch Plot Enhancement

Batch Plot Smarter - From 40 Clicks to Just 3

Vault 2026.1 brings a revolutionary advancement to batch plotting through a markedly simplified workflow. Instead of navigating through a cumbersome process involving 40 manual clicks, users are now able to generate comprehensive drawing lists in merely three clicks by utilizing the new “Plot Related Design Representation Files” command. By selecting the top-level assembly, Vault systematically compiles all pertinent design representation files, which are then prepared for batch plotting. This enhancement not only saves time but also diminishes errors, thereby allowing your teams to concentrate on design rather than file preparation.

![](../images/new-2026-1-batchplot.png)

For more information, see [Access the Plot Manager](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-FF4AA0DF-661B-4381-8E03-E4EDA8F2EB77)

# Layout View Enhancement

Bigger Thumbnails, Faster Decisions

Vault 2026.1 enhances the viewing experience by introducing resizable thumbnails in the Vault grid, allowing for easier differentiation between similar models and drawings at a glance. Users are no longer required to open files individually to locate the correct one. This update substantially decreases the number of clicks necessary, streamlining workflow processes and increasing productivity. With improved visuals and reduced procedural steps, users will spend less time searching and more time focused on delivering results.

# PDF Automatic Item Attachment

Vault 2026.1 significantly enhances operational efficiency through the automation of attaching 2D PDF files during the Assign/Update Item process. The previous manual steps and the possibility of overlooked files have been eliminated; PDFs are now seamlessly integrated with Items, akin to DWG and IDW representations. This improvement guarantees the inclusion of essential documentation, thereby mitigating the risk of oversight and expediting transitions to downstream teams. Stakeholders can now allocate less time to file management and focus more on design efforts.

For more information, see [Assign Items](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-8F7E1A77-FAAF-455E-A0BD-D64D7C4AD9F5)

#### Connectivity Enhancements

# Connectivity Enhancements

Connect Vault to Fusion Manage Seamlessly and Efficiently with the new Vault Connector

# Vault Connector

Vault 2026.1 introduces the Vault Connector, a native, out-of-the-box (OOTB) connector that bridges the gap between design data management and process management systems. The Vault Connector is a powerful new integration that connects Autodesk Vault Professional (PDM) with Fusion Manage (PLM). This solution streamlines enterprise workflows by automating item and BOM synchronization, attaching neutral format files, and mapping attributes between systems. With built-in user notifications, configurable data flows, and support for multiple Vaults within a single Fusion Manage tenant, teams save hours of manual effort and avoid costly errors. From editing Items to creating BOMs, every step is faster, wiser, and fully connected.

# Thin Client Enhancements

Resize, Remember, and Review Faster in the Vault Thin Client

Vault 2026.1 presents a more innovative and efficient approach to managing file properties within the Thin Client environment. The introduction of a resizable property panel, accompanied by persistent panel settings, allows users to instantly view extended property values without the necessity to hover or scroll. This advancement not only conserves time but also mitigates frustration. Furthermore, enhanced caching substantially decreases load times when handling large assemblies, facilitating the revisitation of files without unnecessary waiting periods. The overall experience is quicker and more seamless, allowing users to concentrate on making decisions rather than encountering delays.

The search criteria are saved by default when an Advanced find (property condition) search is saved by the user, and it appears in the "Apply Criteria of" list.

For more information, see [Perform a search](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-0C7AA7BF-9158-4F8D-B312-CE0B2ED174A2).

## Vault Basic Copy Design

Removed the old Copy Design in Vault Basic and replaced it with the Copy Design functionality in Vault Professional.

Copy Design is one of the most powerful features of Autodesk Vault. Engineers are leveraging existing designs by reusing them to save design time or by copying and updating an existing design to reduce design time. Besides the reduced modeling time, design reuse impacts the cost and time savings in downstream engineering, manufacturing, and purchasing.

The new Copy Design provides more flexibility and control over how your designs are copied.

* Copy Design is now a modeless dialog with a toolbar. It can now remain open while you use the Vault Client for other commands as well as add files to be copied.
* You can customize the layout of the Copy Design application by adding and removing column fields, controlling whether grid lines and banding are shown, enabling automatic column-sizing, selecting which Navigation Panels display and which navigation buttons are displayed.
* The Action column displays the current action assigned to a file so you can tell at-a-glance how the file will be handled. Actions include Copy, Copy To, Reuse, Replace, Exclude, and Auto.
* The Navigation Panels help users identify important information about their copied designs and apply certain actions to multiple files at once. Users can filter by file status, view the source and destination of copied files, and explore the folder structure of the copied design.
* Administrators can define rule sets that determine property values for the copied files when certain conditions are met.
* Use the Numbering Scheme Panel to see the old file name, the new name, any prefixes, the base name, and any post-fixes. Administrators can add unique numbering schemes for copy design operations by creating a new numbering scheme in the Vault Client. Users can select from different numbering schemes so that each copied file adheres to a naming convention that suits their design environment.

Refer to the [Copy Design](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-E4C6B707-448D-467E-B7FD-00625A98B791) help topic for more detailed information about this feature.

## Enforce Unique File Name Enhancement

With unique file names enforced, files in the Vault must each have a unique, identifying name. However, depending on the folder structure, the Inventor design data and template location have the same file names. So, if a unique file name check is enforced, those files may fail to check-in.

The enforce unique file name enhancement allows you to enforce unique file names based on the file extension or folder location. You can enable files with specific extensions or files in specified folders to have duplicate file names.

![](../images/new-2024-1-enforceuniquefilename.png)

While enforcing the unique file name, you can:

* Find duplicate file names in the Vault to help resolve any file name conflicts.
* Exclude enforcement by file extension.
* Exclude enforcement by folder.

For more information, see [Enforce Unique File Names](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-B95F67C8-7843-4435-B632-4996A97FFEA5).

## Get Folder

The new Get Folder functionality lets you download a copy of the folder structure from the Vault to the working folder without getting the files. This helps to avoid creating duplicate folders while copying or moving the folders, hence, reducing the time to manage and organize the folder structure. For more information, see [Get Folder from Vault](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-721EE932-D3C9-41C1-8BD6-3D7EEB5FBFD3).

![](../images/new-2024-1-getfolder.png)

You can also use Get Folder while performing the Copy Folder operation. This allows you to download a copy of the folder structure to a local working folder while copying the folder to a set location. For more information, see [Copy Folder](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-8720E24C-4972-4E71-AAE1-1AB1524FF913).

## Display name mapping

Until now, if the display name and the username are different, the property value for the file property shows the display name. However, the property value is set to "User" in the Copy Design rule set behavior. With this update, you can choose the property value (User or Display name) you want to display while defining the Copy Design rule set behavior.

## User Initials

The logged-in user initials now appear consistent across the Vault Client. The profile icon ![](../images/icon-newthinclient-profile-small.png)displays the user initials based on the following behavior:

* If the first name and last name fields are available in Vault, the profile icon displays the first letter from the first name and last name.
* If only the first name field is available in Vault, the profile icon only displays the first letter of the first name. If only the last name field is available in Vault, the profile icon only shows the first letter of the last name.
* If both the first and last names are unavailable in Vault, the profile icon displays the first letter from the display name.

##### Automated CAD Formats for Document Control

# Automated CAD Formats for Document Control

Automatically publish and manage DXF and STEP files from CAD files within the design release process.

To accelerate design documentation, we have added support for DXF and STEP format similar to PDF.

![](../images/new-2024-publishoption-16-9.png)

## Configurable DXF and STEP Settings

Vault 2024 automatically renders DXF and STEP formats from CAD design files using the same settings as the authoring CAD systems. In addition, it supports the 2D and 3D design files from AutoCAD and Inventor drawing files.

For more information, see [Configure DXF Publishing Options](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-57BC9F5B-FBAC-4003-80BA-8C7A352DD503) and [Configure STEP Publishing Options](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-BE2CA612-EB3A-40BE-ACB3-DB530E5926D2).

## Create DXF and STEP upon State Change

Administrators can now configure settings to automatically publish DXF and STEP files for document control at any lifecycle state. During this transition, Vault's Job Processor automatically updates the drawing references and properties to ensure an accurate DXF and STEP representation.

For more information, see [Publish Files](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-F05BFEAF-A362-4070-BBA6-F3A74602967E).

## Create DXF and STEP manually

You can manually create a DXF or STEP of a CAD file using the Create DXF and Create STEP commands available in the toolbar and the context menu. Use these commands to create a DXF or STEP without going through lifecycle state change for a CAD file. Enable the command in the Vault Settings dialog.

For more information, see [Create File](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-EE6877E0-BBEB-4FB2-8B08-F9052F6FCB32).

## Automatic File Attachment

DXF and STEP files created for document control are automatically attached to their accompanying design file.

## Publish and Store Files

PDF, DXF, and STEP files published for document control can be stored in the vault or outside the vault on a local drive. In addition, administrators may designate a local folder for document control similar to the vault folder structure.

For more information, see [DXF Publish Location](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-5D7A9317-7428-49D9-90F0-59FC69D6C569) and [STEP Publish Location](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-7D1947BD-8A06-4110-8115-5DE0506F803D).

##### Peer Review for Lifecycle State Transition

# Peer Review for Lifecycle State Transition

Learn about the new capability available to administer lifecycle state change.

![](../images/new-2024-peerreview-16-9.png)

As an administrator, you can configure a peer review check to be met before a state change can occur. The controlling mechanism checks whether the current user is not the same user who has executed the previous state change. This functionality can be used to facilitate delegation of authority and increase transparency.

* You can define multiple transition criteria determining when a state transition can occur.
* Once the criteria are met, the system checks the user in the 'From' and 'To' states. The user who set the file in the 'From' state of the transition won't be able to change the state to the 'To' state.

For more information, see [Edit Lifecycle State Transitions](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-B4443A39-A621-4E14-8A11-484EFBF3DB90).

## Backup and Restore Enhancements

![](../images/new-2024-backuprestore-16-9.png)

What's new:

* **Backup databases without any files**

  As an administrator, you can backup vault databases during the backup process to save space and time. When the "Backup databases" option is selected, the file store isn't backed up.
* **Select vaults or libraries for backup**

  You can select the vaults and libraries you want to backup to save time and space. Vault and libraries that are not selected for backup don't appear in the restored environment.
* **Use existing file store files on the local machine**

  You can use existing files in the file store during restore.

  Note: Ensure correct file stores are copied to the destination folder.
* **No file store validation**

  As an administrator, you can choose the option not to run the file store validation during a restore. When file store validation is not executed, the restored backup doesn't have a file store.
* **Redirect file store**

  You can redirect a vault to a new file store location. Different from moving the file store, shifting the file store location allows the administrator to prepare a new place for the file store while the existing file store is in use. Once the new location is ready, redirect the vault to the new location without moving files during the operation.

For more information, see [Back up or Restore a Vault](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-FAEEA4AC-D642-4136-9EB0-1058EA3F5DC3) and [Redirect the Vault File Store](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-163CCB73-F6E1-4E09-ACF5-D99B13A8FC1E).

## Purge Enhancements

Use Export Candidates to generate a pre-report (.csv file) that shows the list of purge candidates.

Note: The pre-report includes all file versions that can be purged. However, some candidate file versions can't be purged if some non-purgeable parent files use them.

For more information, see [Purge Files in a Vault](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-379CAADD-69B5-4408-B402-F421208DD574).

### Removed Inventor View from the Viewer Options

The "Inventor View" option to view the Inventor files has been removed from the Vault settings options. The "Inventor Read-only Mode" is now the default setting to preview the Inventor files.

### Inventor Read-only Mode for Viewing Files

The "Inventor Read-only Mode" is now the default setting for viewing the Inventor files.

You can view the Inventor files for read-only purposes. You can't edit or update the files using Vault commands in the Inventor read-only mode. The Vault administrator can provide read-only access to the users who need just to view the Inventor files.

Note: The Vault add-in for Inventor Read-only Mode is only available for Vault Professional.

## "Has Drawing" Property

To allow all design and drawing files to have the same lifecycle definition, the "Has Drawing" system property value for drawings is set to True Always. You can ensure that the objects are only released if an associated drawing exists by using the property check-in lifecycle transition, and hence be able to identify and filter the components without an associated drawing

# Administration Enhancements

Learn about the new capabilities and enhancements available for administration in this release.

## Lifecycle state colors

Lifecycle Definition settings is enhanced to allow color customization for indicating a lifecycle state. You can now easily identify lifecycle states by color across all clients and user interfaces.

![](../images/new-2023-lifecyclestatecolor-16-9.png)

## Design file restriction

As an administrator, you can define the list of design files not to be checked in when the "Enforce Restriction for Check In of Design Files" is turned on. You can add the file extensions to the user-defined list but can't remove the system default extensions.

With this restriction, the user can't add restricted files via Vault Client (drag-and-drop or "Add Files" feature). They can only add restricted files using the add-in client for corresponding CAD applications to retain and maintain file relationships.

![](../images/new-2023-filetyperestriction.png)

For more information, see [Manage File Restrictions](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-DA5304A2-B669-48F7-A7EA-1053E44F776F).

**Parent page:** [2023 Updates and Enhancements](VLT-UANDE-2023.htm)


##### Vault Gateway

# Vault Gateway

Connect remotely to Vault with Vault Gateway.

In the Vault 2023 release, Vault Gateway was developed to provide secure remote access to users working remotely. As a result, remote users can create and manage design data in Vault and enjoy the same experience as in the office. In addition, Vault Gateway allows VPN-less access to vaulted data behind the firewall with no additional configurations required on the Vault Client.

**Expanded Collaboration**

Vault Gateway allows better collaboration with suppliers and 3rd party collaborators. There is no need to create domain accounts for these users and give them VPN access. Instead, administrators can create Vault or Autodesk ID accounts along with the Vault Gateway URL, and these users get complete access to the vaulted data.

For more information, see [Vault Gateway](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-725723AF-CCFD-48A2-8A20-C332B9A75608).

## Notes

1. All clients and servers should be upgraded at the same time to the Vault Update level.
2. The 'VaultServer\_Update.exe' and 'VaultFileServer\_Update.exe' are EXE wrappers. You can use /e to extract its content. For e.g. “Autodesk\_VaultServer\_2026.0.1\_Update.exe” /e “C:\Extract”. The contents will be extracted to "C:\Extract". For the ‘VaultClient\_Update.exe', just run it, the contents will be extracted to folder C:\Users\*user\_name*\AppData\Local\Temp\Autodesk\_VaultClient\_2026.0.1\_Update
3. You may get Error 3050/3051 when installing Vault Client 2026 update if the install component version is too low. Please follow the “How do I fix this” instruction to install the latest install components first.

## What Is Vault?

# What Is Vault?

Vault data management software helps organize, manage, and track data creation, simulation, and documentation processes for design, engineering, and construction teams.

You can organize all your files and keep them in one location for easy access. All file versions are retained, so you never misplace or replace past versions. The vault stores each version of a file, along with all file dependencies, giving you a living history of the project as you work on it. The vault also stores file properties for rapid searching and retrieving.

In a design team, all the files and associated data are stored on the server so all users have access to the information and its history. Each member of a team must have a unique login name and password. Team members check out files to prevent more than one member from editing the same file at the same time. Once a file is checked back into the vault, team members can refresh their local copies of the model file to get the latest version from the vault, so all members of the design team work together.

Autodesk Vault consists of two main components: a client and a server. Additional components, such as add-ins, the file server, and the job processor, help create a cohesive data management ecosystem.

The Vault client allows you to perform document management functions, such as checking files in and out or copying designs. The server stores the master copies of all your documents and designs. By storing all your data in a common, centralized location, you can easily share and manage information with your design team. This centralized location is called a vault. When you first launch the Vault client, you must select the vault that you want to log into before you can start managing your data.

## What Is a Vault?

A vault is a repository where documents and files are stored and managed. It has two principle components: a relational database and a file store.

* The relational database stores information about the files. Information stored in the database includes current file status, file edit histories, and file property data. Storing file information in a database provides a scalable, secure, and high performance platform for documenting file relationships and histories. File information and relationships can also be searched, queried, and reported.
* The file store is hierarchy of folders where the Vault server stores the physical copies of the files managed by Autodesk Vault . The vault maintains a copy of each version of a file and saves them to the file store in a proprietary configuration. The file store is considered a closed system. Do not reconfigure files in the file store or edit any of the files directly from the file store. The vault server uses the database and file store to provide users with a collaborative working environment.

Separate software components are installed for the server and for client applications.

## Vault Server

Three primary components make up the Vault server: a web server, a database, and a file store. The following figure illustrates the basic configuration of the components.

![](../images/single_vault_cap.png)

### Database Server

The database server tracks all the relationships between data. It acts like a library card catalog, containing indexes and pointers of where to find related information.

By default, the Autodesk data management server installs Microsoft® SQL Server Express. Microsoft SQL Server Express can be upgraded any time after the Autodesk Data Management Server components are installed.

See [Vault Requirements](https://www.autodesk.com/Vault-system) and [Upgrade Autodesk Vault](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-77487172-0582-4912-83B1-2E4847716AE0) for more information.

### File Store

The file store and the database server work with each other. The database provides the index information for the location of files. The file store is the secure location on the server where the files are located.

Note: Never directly move, delete, or edit a file in the file store. Use the Autodesk Data Management Server console to manage the file store.

### Web Server

Autodesk Data Management Server requires that Windows Internet Information Services (IIS) is installed.

Note: If IIS is not installed on the computer that hosts the server, and you require more than a single-user installation, install IIS before you install Autodesk Vault server.

Note: The original Microsoft Windows installation media might be necessary to complete the IIS installation.

The Autodesk Vault server is actually a Web application that uses services to manage the communication between the clients and the server with Web services. The interaction between the clients and the server resembles the way a web browser communicates with a site on the Internet. The Web services use standard HTTP methods, communicating over the Web server port 80 by default. Microsoft IIS is required for multiple-user configurations.

#### Proxy Server

A proxy server forwards requests of client computers to other servers. Some networks force all client computers to use a proxy server for all web service requests.

![](../images/single_vault_cap_proxy.png)

If your network uses a proxy server, you can configure it to use a host name or bypass the proxy server of your host clients.

Note: For more information about configuring a proxy server, see [Configure Vault to Use a Proxy Server](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-3BA3F33B-C0BD-47B1-9DBC-3D9DB9A21ABB).

## Vault Clients

A Vault client is any stand-alone application or integrated add-in that connects to the vault server to access files and perform vault operations.

An example is the Inventor add-in. When data is added to a vault using the Inventor add-in, the add-in preserves all the complex relationships that are created by assemblies, drawings, presentations, and other files.

A single vault environment has one vault server and one or more vault clients. There is a Vault thick client, a Vault thin client, and Vault add-ins that integrate with other applications. Users also have the option of installing the Vault Office thick client.

### Vault Client

You can use the Vault thick client, sometimes referred to as the Vault Explorer client, to browse the complete Vault structure, add any file to the vault, and perform most other file-based operations, depending on your level of permission. You can also configure revision schemes, numbering schemes, define lifecycle behavior, manage items and change orders, and perform other administrative tasks in the vault stand-alone client. The features available for administration depend on which [Vault edition](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-AC53CA07-BD55-4C7E-9483-288FFAAFCC9A) you are using.

### Vault Thin Client

The Vault thin client lets you browse the contents of a vault. If you have a Vault Office license, you can also perform file management tasks, such as adding files to a vault and checking files in and out of a vault.

Autodesk Vault Professional users can also review items and bills of materials (BOMs).

### Vault Add-in Client

Add-in clients provide basic vault functions within the environment of a parent application. Add-ins maintain application-specific data relationships when adding files to a vault.

Note: As a rule, if an integrated client is available for a particular application, managing files using that client ensures data integrity, such as with assembly relationships. We recommend that you use integrated clients whenever possible.

There are add-ins available for Autodesk and non-Autodesk design applications. [Refer to Which Applications Support the Vault Add-in?](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-334CC890-1F12-429C-9D6A-B964327CA590) for more information.

### Vault Office Client

The Vault Office client is similar to the full Vault client, but provides only non-CAD file and folder data management options. This client is ideal for users who do not need all of the CAD functionality of a the full Vault client, but who still need to manage documents in a vault.


## How Vault Works

# How Vault Works

Learn about the steps Autodesk Vault takes when a user checks a file out of a vault.

1. Vault client checks out a file.
2. Vault client sends a request for the file to the Vault server.
3. Vault server sends a query to the database.
4. Vault server copies the files from the file store to the client.

It is important to note that the client computer does not directly communicate with another client computer at any time.

Note: The option to configure remote SQL is available only with Vault Professional.


## Vault Editions

# Vault Editions

Autodesk Vault editions allow you to choose the functionality and workflow solutions that suit your specific business needs.

## Autodesk Vault Basic

Vault Basic securely stores and manages data in a central location, helping teams to quickly create, share, and reuse digital prototyping information. Users have basic version control over vaulted files and can quickly package files for sharing.

## Autodesk Vault Professional

Vault Professional securely stores and manages engineering information, design data, and documents shortening the design-to-build and manufacture process. It includes multi-site tools to connect workgroups across discrete locations, helping the entire design chain collaborate and share project information. Take full advantage of advanced functionality by giving design departments the tools they need to track change orders, manage bills of materials (BOMs), and promote earlier collaboration through integration to expert business systems. In addition, support for multi-CAD environments means that Vault clients using non-Autodesk design products can aggregate and manage design data throughout its lifecycle.

### Support for Prior Vault Clients and Add-Ins

The Vault Autodesk Data Management Server (ADMS) supports the current and two releases back clients that match the Vault edition of ADMS.

The Vault ADMS supports the the current and two releases back Add-Ins. You need to install the previous version of Vault Client to use the previous version add-in.

It is not recommended that you administer Vault Settings or Global Settings using a client of a prior release version. Administration of Vault Settings and Global Settings should be done using an ADMS Console or Vault client of the same release as the target Vault server.

New functionality available in Vault 2026 is not available in prior releases of Vault clients and Add-Ins.

Some functionality in a Vault 2026 client may not work when only an older version of the CAD application is installed or if an older version of the CAD application was last run. Installing and running the 2026 version of the CAD application and/or 2026 components (e.g., Inventor View, Trueview, etc.) and retrying the operation may resolve the issue.

Note: The third-party Vault add-in (Server side) must be on the same version as the Vault Server version. For example, with Vault Server 2026, you need to install Vault 2026 add-in for SolidWorks (Server side).

Learn how to set up and implement Vault Server and Client.

## Before You Begin

Before setting up the Vault, it is recommended to perform the following steps:

### Understand the Vault Architecture

Autodesk Vault consists of two main components that make up its architecture: the Vault Client and the Vault Server. The client allows you to perform document management functions, such as checking files in and out and copying designs. The server stores the master copies of all your documents and designs. Each component is explained in more detail in this [topic](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-87D9CA09-9881-4506-9465-0677392BCD7E).

### System Requirements

Before installation, verify that your hardware meets the minimum system requirements. See [system requirements](https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/vault-products/troubleshooting/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/System-requirements-for-Autodesk-Vault-products.html) for more information about Autodesk Vault system requirements.

Anti-virus software can affect installation and performance of the Vault software. See [How to improve performance when running Autodesk Vault with antivirus software?](https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/vault-products/troubleshooting/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/How-to-improve-performance-when-running-Autodesk-Vault-with-antivirus-software.html) for more information.

## Getting Started

Note: Ensure that the latest updates for the Vault Server and Client are installed. If upgrading, ensure the server updates are installed before migrating any databases. See [Upgrade Autodesk Vault](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-F7C93287-98E9-4950-93A0-E7A3BC96181E) to upgrade your system. Visit [Downloads](https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/vault-products/downloads) for details on product downloads and updates.

## Install the Vault Server

The Vault Server uses a Microsoft SQL Server for the backend database. The server keeps all design and documentation files in a shared, secure, and centralized location and manages access to that data. To learn about the Vault Server and managing vault, see [Vault Server Administration](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-ED2DFFB2-EFA8-4A48-816B-37B2C67A6D20).

There are three types of Vault Server installations: Quick Start Single Site, Customized Single Site, and Distributed Teams installation. The most robust way is to install the Vault Server on a separate computer dedicated to Vault and allow the clients to communicate with the server. See [Vault Server Installation](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-ECD4A36F-582C-4413-A990-2989787FB6DD) for more information.

### Manage Vault

When you install the Vault Server, a new vault needs to be created to get started. You can [create a new Vault](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-BB1841F6-C49F-4538-904C-AB198B884E75) or restore an existing Vault in the Vault Server Console (ADMS).

Vault can create and manage multiple vaults. When working with various vaults, the data is separate and can't be shared across vaults. To learn about how vaults and databases work, see [Manage Vaults and Databases](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-0CDEB715-024E-41D4-BD1C-100AE37408EB).

### Install the Vault Client

A Vault Client is any application that connects to the Vault Server to perform vault operations such as check-in or check-out or copying designs. The Vault Server must be installed and configured before a client can access the server. See [Install the Vault Client](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-C3D45E7C-68FA-4EE5-909D-E6D183F22F6A) for more information.

Notes:

* Before installing the Vault Client, close all Autodesk and Microsoft applications and disable any virus scanning software.
* Remove all historical data before loading any data into the Vault.
* Ensure that the Vault Client release that you are installing matches the release year of the Vault Server that you installed. See Upgrading Vault for more information.
* All Vault [CAD add-ins](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-BBF6DA24-6B8C-4CEF-ACC5-619432AE5E10) are installed with Vault Client. CAD software installed after the Vault Client is installed automatically includes the Vault add-in available.

## Setup Vault with Inventor

If using Inventor, set up Vault for using a default Inventor project file and to enforce a consistent client working folder. See the help topic for more information.

## Upload Data to Vault

Use the Vault Autoloader utility to upload existing Inventor assemblies, parts, and libraries into the Vault.

The Autoloader utility is designed to produce clean, reliable results when loading data in a format that allows the Vault to work most efficiently in the long term. It is recommended to use this tool to perform your initial data load. Then, upon completion, you can leverage its resultant folder structure and Inventor project file for all your work. See [Autoloader](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-EA9B2552-30B9-4789-9A5E-6580B8648981) for more information.

## Vault Settings Options

Go to Tools > Administration > Vault Settings and set the following options:

* Enforcing Unique File Names
* Disable Check in of Design Files

![](../images/vault-settings-options.png)

### Enforce Unique File Names

After bulk loading historical data to the Vault, turn on "Enforce Unique File Names".

By default, unique file names are not enforced in the Vault. The only restriction is that two files with the same name cannot exist in the same folder. With unique file names enforced, files in the Vault must each have a unique, identifying name. See [Enforcing Unique File Names](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-B95F67C8-7843-4435-B632-4996A97FFEA5) for more information.

### Enforce Restriction for Check In of Design Files

The "Enforce Restriction for Check In of Design Files" option prevents users from uploading restricted files into the Vault. By default, this option is checked. See [Manage File Restriction](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-DA5304A2-B669-48F7-A7EA-1053E44F776F) for more information.

## Add Files to a Vault with the Inventor Vault Add-in

Upload all data to the Vault using Vault add-ins for Inventor to check in new files to Vault. See [Adding Files to a Vault with the Inventor Vault Add-in](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-D3062CE1-0541-4F28-B95F-434490C12DAC) for more information.

## Backup Your Vault

Always make sure you have a valid backup of your vaulted data. It is essential to use the backup feature in Vault Server Console (ADMS) to back up your vault. See [Back Up or Restore a Vault](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-B9EDA55D-EEC3-4CA4-B8C3-F5C6F0B72290) for more information.

See this [support article](https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/vault-products/learn-explore/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/What-is-a-Vault-Disaster-Recovery-Plan.html) on Vault Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP) to understand how DRP can be implemented in the event of a disaster.

## Run a SQL Maintenance Plan

Run a SQL Maintenance plan once per week. This ensures that the database is always optimized for performance. See [Server Maintenance Part 6: Create SQL Maintenance Plan](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-B294A257-8EC3-43E8-BC46-D701594C78FD) for SQL Standard and Express edition.


### Setup Vault with Inventor

# Setup Vault with Inventor

This section describes the recommended procedure for setting up Vault and Inventor with a default Inventor Project File (\*.ipj).

## Setup Your Environment

Typically with Inventor, you create an Inventor Project File (\*.ipj) that is unique for each job you are working on. With Inventor and Vault, you create a new folder for each design, not a new project file. The following steps show how to configure Vault in the simplest way.

1. On the Vault server machine, open Autodesk Data Management Server Console 20xx. On the left side of the window, right-click Vaults and click Create. For the illustration purpose, let's name the new vault "TestProject". Click OK.

   If you want to change the Vault name, you can rename it in the ADMS Console by detaching and reattaching the database.

   ![](../images/create-a-vault.png)
2. On a workstation machine, open Windows Explorer. Create a folder under "C:\" called "Work". This is where all work on Inventor parts will be performed. In addition, create two new folders underneath Work called "Content Center Files" and "Designs". These folders will store all of your design data.

   ![](../images/work-folders.png)

   Note: To avoid file status conflicts and performance issues, avoid using a centralized network share as Inventors Workspace. Also variables like %USERPROFILE% are not beneficial as the references would need to be resolved each time a new user opens the assembly and updates it.
3. Open Inventor and the Project Editor. Click New at the bottom and step through the wizard to create a new Vault Project.

   ![](../images/inventor-project-editor-2025.png)

   ![](../images/inventor-project-wizard-selection.png)
4. Enter Designs for the project name and set the Project (Workspace) Folder to "C:\Work".

   ![](../images/inventor-project-wizard-designs.png)
5. Click Finish to create the project file.
6. Double-click Designs.ipj to make it the active project.
7. In the Project Editor window, click the expand button next to Workspace, then click twice to edit the location of the Workspace folder and type "\Designs". Click again to finish editing.

   ![](../images/inventor-project-editor-folderOptions2025.png)
8. In the same way, expand Folder Options and edit the Content Center Files option to read ".\Content Center Files".

   Edit the Templates option to read ".\Templates".

   Edit the Design Data option to read ".\Design Data".

   Note: Typing ".\" instructs Inventor to use a path relative to the project file. This means that the project file could be located anywhere on a user's machine, but it will always look in a subfolder called Content Center Files or Templates or Design Data.
9. Click Save to save the changes made to the Project file, and then click Done to exit the Inventor Project Editor.
10. On the Inventor ribbon, click the Vault tab, and then click Login.
11. On the Vault Login dialog, type in the Vault server name in the Server field.
12. In the Vault Login dialog, click the ellipses next to the Vault field. Select the newly created Vault database and log in as a user with (Vault) Administrator privileges.

    ![](../images/Login_SelectVault.png)
13. Click the drop-down list arrow next to the Access command, and then click Map Folders. This will map the actual folders defined in the project file with the Vaults virtual folder structure.

    ![](../images/inventor-vault-access-map-folders.png)
14. In the Project Folder Mapping dialog, select Project Root and click Edit to create a mapping between the local project file and its intended location in the Vault. In this case, we are mapping the project file location to the root ($) of Vault.
15. Repeat for the Content Center Files folder, Template and Design Data folder.

    Select Content Center Files and click Edit to create a mapping between the Content Center Files and its intended location in the Vault. Here in this case, we are creating a new folder for Content Center Files. Enter the folder name as Content Center Files.

    Note: Ensure that the Library folder option is selected. Vault project file creation logic dictates that all libraries must be located beneath the project file.

    Select Templates and Design Data and click Edit to create a mapping between the Inventor Templates and Design Data folder and its intended location in the Vault. This will help to synchronize and administer Inventor templates/design data in Vault thus ensuring that each workstation has the latest templates/design data.

    As a best practice, do not enforce unique file names if any files with duplicate names are stored in the folder. When you are attempting to map the Vault folder, the setting can be temporarily turned off to allow the mapping. See [Enforce Unique File Names](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-B95F67C8-7843-4435-B632-4996A97FFEA5) for more information.

    ![](../images/DesignData_MapProperties.png)

1. Click OK and OK again to close the Project Folder Mapping dialog.

You should now have the correct structure configured to begin adding Inventor files to the Vault.

Note: $/Designs in Vault Explorer is equal to "C:\Work\Designs" in Windows Explorer. The structure inside and outside the Vault must match.

## Add Data to the Vault

You are now ready to start adding data to your Vault.

1. In Inventor, create a new part file and then click Save. It does not need to have any geometry; we just need to create a file.

   ![](../images/inventor-new-part-file-newInvicon.png)

   ![](../images/inventor-new-part-file-name-newInvicon.png)
2. Save the file, and give it a name. By default, Inventor saves it in the workspace folder (C:\Work\Designs) and assign the file a name "Part1.ipt" for now. Click OK.
3. Once the file is saved locally, check the file into Vault. There are many ways to do this, but, for now, perhaps the easiest, is to select Vault in the ribbon bar and select "Check In". The Check In dialog displays.

   In this window, you can see that both the project file and the part file will be checked in to Vault.

   The project file is located locally in "C:\Work\Designs.ipj". The file will be vaulted as "$\Designs.ipj"

   The part file is located locally in "C:\Work\Designs\Part1.ipj". The file will be vaulted as "$\Designs\Part1.ipj".

   The intention of this method is that all subsequent work will be done beneath the "\Designs" folder.

   ![](../images/checkin-part-file-newInvicon.png)
4. While performing a check-in, DWF files can be created and linked (attached) to the file being checked in. The advantage of this is that it allows other users to review the file as it was checked in to Vault. The advantage of this is that it gives other users, who maybe do not have the ability to view the file in its native application, the opportunity to review the file as it was checked in to Vault. This option is off, by default. To enable DWF creation during checking, click Settings and select either "Create during check-in" or "Send to Job Server".

   Note: "Send to Job Server" is an option that is only available to users of Vault Professional.

   ![](../images/checkin-part-file-settings-newInvicon.png)
5. Once satisfied with the DWF publication options, click OK, and then click OK again to check the file into the Vault for the first time. A progress bar appears while the DWF file is created and copied into the Vault. Once the operation is complete, the dialog disappears.

## Configure the Vault Settings

1. Once the file has been checked in to Vault, open the Vault Client and log in as a member of the Administrators group.
2. In the Vault Client, go to Tools > Administration > Vault Settings.
3. In the Vault Settings dialog, click Define in the Files tab to enforce a consistent working folder for all clients.

   ![](../images/vault-settings-working-folder-options.png)
4. In the Working Folder Options dialog, select "Enforce consistent working folder for all clients" option and change Client Working Folder to "C:\Work". This ensures that all users connecting to this Vault database will be using the same local working folder. This is an optional setting.
5. Select the "Enforce consistent project file for all clients" check box and change the Default Inventor Project File to $/Designs.ipj. This ensures that if multiple project files are checked into the Vault, features such as Copy Design, Move, Rename, and the Job Processor will all defer to this project file. The advantage of this, is that it reduces the likelihood of unresolved links in Inventor. The only way to avoid unresolved link issues in the future is to prohibit multiple Inventor project files entirely. This is an optional setting.
6. Click OK to save.

## Share Data with Other Users

The next step is to get all your users up and running with Vault. This starts with creating a Vault user account for them.

For each user, do the following:

1. In the Vault Client, create the user account and grant them access to the Vault you created and assign them a role. See Add a New User for more information.
2. On the user's machine, install the Vault client and log them into the Vault database.
3. Right-click the Designs.ipj in the Vault client and select "Get". This automatically downloads the ipj file to the same location, "C:\Work".

   ![](../images/inventor-project-file-get-command.png)
4. Start Inventor, and change the Active Project to "C:\Work\Designs.ipj".
5. Each user can copy their Inventor files into folders beneath "C:\Work\Designs" and open them in Inventor starting with drawings and assemblies.

   Note: If prompted with a message to resolve a missing file, ensure that the file is copied beneath the C:\Work folder before being checked in to the Vault.

### Purge

# Purge

Have you tried purge to manage the version history in vault? Versions that are no longer needed can be purged from the vault, creating a more compact vault database, and improving the overall performance of the vault.

## Overview

Each time a file is updated in the vault, a version is saved within the vault. The versions range from the initial draft version to versions representing work in progress to the final version. Over time, as the number of versions increases, the file store size will increase to reflect that. Some of these versions are irrelevant to the design history and no longer needed in the vault.

Using the Purge wizard, you can manage the Files and Items version history in a vault. Versions that are no longer needed can be purged from the vault, creating a more compact vault database and improving the overall performance of the vault. Performing a backup before completing the purge operation is highly recommended, as you would not want to delete any important file accidentally.

Note: You must be assigned the role of Administrator or Document Editor II to perform this action. Contact your Vault administrator to see if you have been given either of these roles. File versions being purged, and all related files must be checked into the vault before purging.

### Purge Guidelines

Here are some of the basic rules of purging:

* The latest version in a revision can't be purged (this revision is never removed). To remove a file and all its versions from a vault, use Delete.
* File versions that are labeled can't be purged.
* Files that are currently checked out can have their older versions purged.
* Children with a dependent parent version cannot be purged until the parent version has been purged.
* The Administrator role has a further restriction, and a version can't be purged if a parent exists and is not part of the existing action set.
* For Autodesk Vault Professional:

  + File versions linked to items in Vault Professional cannot be purged. To remove a version linked to an item, the item must first be deleted from the item master.
  + File versions marked as Controlled by the lifecycle definition may not be purged.
  + Files are purged based on revision and lifecycle rules. Configure the Version Selection Criteria section in the Purge dialog to purge files that are not controlled by a lifecycle.
  + Files without a revision scheme are considered a "null" revision and are not purgeable when configured with a lifecycle. To purge based on lifecycle control rules, a revision scheme must be assigned to the lifecycle, and the target of the purge must utilize the revision scheme.

### Purging Files/Items

Purging files/items can be done on the entire vault from within the Autodesk Data Management Server (ADMS) console, or you can purge specific versions from the Main Client view or the History tab.

#### Purge Files/Items in a Vault from the ADMS console

Let's go into the Autodesk Data Management Server Console and look at how to do that.

##### Purge Files

Files are purged based on revision and [lifecycle rules](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-02294D64-9ACA-4546-956E-095D9D7814B1). Configure the version selection criteria section in the Purge Files dialog to purge files not controlled by a lifecycle.

To purge files from the server console:

* Log into the ADMS console.
* Right-click a vault from within the Vaults folder and select Purge Files, or

  Select the vault from the Vaults folder and click Actions > Purge Files.

  You are prompted to set the number of files you want to keep (noting you can never purge the latest), how old the files should be, or, based on comments, what files you want to keep. Combining these settings results in a list of file versions that are eligible to be purged.
* In the Purge Files dialog, turn on the check box next to each of the selection rules to determine the data to be purged:

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Versions except latest | Specify how many file versions to leave in the vault. |
  | Versions older than days | Specify how old the files to purge should be. |
  | Exclude versions where comment contains | Enter a text string contained within the Comments field of the files in the vault. Any files containing this string will be excluded from the purge process. This option is only available if any of the above checkboxes are selected.  Enter an asterisk (\*) in the Comments field. Any file version which has a comment will be excluded from the purge.  Note: This asterisk (\*) workflow is supported only for 'Versions not controlled by Lifecycles.’ |
* Click Export Candidates to generate a pre-report (.csv file) that shows the list of purge candidates.

  Note: The pre-report includes all file versions that can be purged. However, some candidate file versions can't be purged if some non-purgeable parent files use them.
* Click OK to initiate the purge.

Every version of every file within the vault will be analyzed and purged using these settings. However, file versions that are part of file or item revisions are not purged, even if they match all these settings.

Note: When working with the vault like this, performing a backup before completing the purge operation is highly recommended.

![](../images/hyt-purgefiles-myvault-16-9.png)

Here, in this example, we have a vault named MYVAULT. We specify to keep all the versions except the latest three, or we could even say the latest five. We can also purge it based on time, so we specify to purge everything half a year old. In addition, we can exclude the version from being purged with a particular comment, for instance, "do not purge."

##### Purge File Versions from the Command Line

```
 Connectivity.ADMSConsole.exe -Opurge -Nvault name -KEEPVERSnumberX -MINAGEnumberX -EXCLCMTcomment -UNCONTROLLED -VUusername -VPpassword

##### Disable Purge from the Command Line

The purge feature can be disabled from the command prompt:

```
Connectivity.ADMSConsole.exe -Odisablepurge -Ndatabasename -VUusername -VPpassword
```

See [Disable Purge from the Command Line](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-6866DCDB-BF89-490E-8DE1-188A90352F50) for details.

##### Purge Items

Item versions are purged based on their [lifecycle control settings](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-02294D64-9ACA-4546-956E-095D9D7814B1). You can't purge any item version if an item does not have a lifecycle assignment.

To purge items from the server console:

* Log into the ADMS console.
* Right-click a vault from within the Vaults folder, and select Purge Items, or

  Select the vault from the Vaults folder and click Actions > Purge Items.
* Click OK to initiate the purge.

##### Purge Items from the Command Line

```
Connectivity.ADMSConsole.exe -Opurge -Nvault name -ITEMS -VUusername -VPpassword
```

See [Purge Items from the Command Line](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-E9D19C4F-957E-42B0-A998-8A93E202AD9A) for details.

#### Purge versions from the Main Client view

Purge file/item versions from a vault from the main client view.

To purge files from the main Vault Client:

1. Select a file or files, and then select Purge from the Edit menu, or

   Right-click a file, and then select Purge.
2. The Purge Wizard lists the file or files that were selected from the main pane. Click Add Files to include other files from the vault.

   To exclude a file from being purged, select it from the list and then click Remove.

   The parents and children of a selected file can be included in the purge. Right-click on a file in the list and select Add Parents or Add Children to include the related files.
3. Click Next.
4. Click the Purge versions not controlled by Lifecycles check box to purge versions not defined by revision and lifecycle rules. This action enables the Specify the version selection criteria box.
5. In the Specify the version selection criteria box, turn on the check box next to each of the selection rules to determine the data to be purged:

   |  |  |
   | --- | --- |
   | Versions except latest | Specify how many file versions to leave in the vault. |
   | Versions older than days | Specify how old the files to purge should be. |
   | Exclude versions where comment contains | Enter a text string contained within the Comments field of the files in the vault. Any files containing this string will be excluded from the purge process. This option is only available if any of the above checkboxes are selected.  Enter an asterisk (\*) in the Comments field. Any file version which has a comment will be excluded from the purge.  Note: This asterisk (\*) workflow is supported only for 'Versions not controlled by Lifecycles.’ |

   ![](../images/hyt-purgewizard.png)
6. Click Next.
7. If there are any restrictions on the versions to be purged, the restricted versions and the reason for the restrictions are listed.
8. Click Finish to purge those versions that are not restricted, or click Cancel to exit the Purge Wizard.

   Note: Versions that are restricted because they are linked to items in Vault Professional cannot be purged unconditionally when the version is a dependent of a parent file version. The corresponding item must be deleted from the item master before the version can be purged.
9. The Purge Results screen summarizes the versions that were successfully removed and the versions that were not purged due to vault restrictions.
10. You can choose to generate a report as an Excel file (.xls) and save it locally or in the vault by performing one of these options:

    * To save the report locally, click Save. On the Save As dialog, navigate to the folder structure where you want to store the file locally. Enter a name for the report and click Save.
    * To save the report in a vault, click Send to Vault to display a list of vault folders. Select the vault where you want the report saved, enter a name for the report, and click Save.
11. Click Close.

#### Purge file versions from the History tab

You can also purge specific versions of a file from the History tab.

1. Select a file and then click the History tab.
2. From the History tab, select a file version or versions and then select Edit > Purge, or

   Right-click a file, and then select Purge.
3. The Purge Wizard starts at the Restricted File Versions screen. If there are any restrictions on the versions to be purged, the restricted versions and the reason for the restrictions are listed.
4. Click Finish to purge those versions that are not restricted, or click Cancel to exit the Purge Wizard.

   If you have been assigned the role of Administrator, you can choose to purge even the restricted versions. Turn on Ignore restrictions (Purge unconditionally) and then click Finish to override any purge restrictions. Note that if you are purging versions from history tab, the Ignore restrictions (Purge unconditionally) check box is enabled when a file is labeled or is marked as Controlled by the lifecycle definition.

   Note: Versions that are restricted because they are linked to items in Vault Professional cannot be purged unconditionally when the version is a dependent of a parent file version. The corresponding item must be deleted from the item master before the version can be purged.
5. The Purge Results screen summarizes the versions that were successfully removed and the versions that were not purged due to vault restrictions.
6. You can choose to generate a report as an Excel file (.xls) and save it locally or in the vault by performing one of these options:

   * To save the report locally, click Save. On the Save As dialog, navigate to the folder structure where you want to store the file locally. Enter a name for the report and click Save.
   * To save the report in a vault, click Send to Vault to display a list of vault folders. Select the vault where you want the report saved, enter a name for the report, and click Save.
7. Click Close.

## Purging in case of lifecycle states

When you set up your lifecycle states, there is a Control tab where you can set what file versions should be kept: all versions in that state, the first and last versions, the last version in that state, or none. Configure your purge preferences for files assigned to a lifecycle definition to help manage Vault file retention. Purging Vault will always purge first based on lifecycle control settings.

To configure the control preferences:

1. Click Tools > Administration > Vault Settings.
2. In the Vault Settings dialog, click the Behaviors tab > Lifecycles.
3. In the Lifecycle Definition dialog, select the name of the lifecycle definition, and then click Edit.
4. From the Lifecycle States grid, select the state you want to edit and click the Control tab.
5. Select one of the following options:

   * **All** - No versions in this state are removed when a purge is performed. This option is recommended for states where not many versions are created or where each version is critical.
   * **First and Last** - All versions in this state are removed during a purge, except each series' first and last version. Use this option for states where the changes between the first and last files are helpful.
   * **Last** - All versions in this state are removed during a purge, except the last version in each series. This option is recommended for states where a record that the file was in the state is essential.
   * **None** - No version in this state will be retained after the purge, except the tip version of a revision and the versions consumed by a parent file.

   Note: The basic purging rules are also applied to the selected option

   **Important:** No record of the file in this state will exist after the purge.

   ![](../images/hyt-purge-lcdcontrolsettings.png)
6. Turn on the Include existing files versions check box to apply purge restrictions for lifecycle states for existing versions of files.

   Note: If this box is not checked, the purge version control settings apply only to new file versions.

When you now purge your vault, the list of eligible files and items is built from the lifecycle control setting for that version.

Here is an example that highlights what files will be purged in a lifecycle scheme scenario. Considering there are no dependencies, the following are the purge settings:

* Released: Last
* For Review: First and last
* Work in Progress: None

We have different versions at different revisions and lifecycle states.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| V1 | V2 | V3 | V4 | V5 | V6 | V7 | V8 | V9 | V10 |
| Rev A | Rev A | Rev A | Rev A | Rev B | Rev B | Rev B | Rev C | Rev C | Rev C |
| Work in Progress | Work in Progress | For Review | Released | Work in Progress | Work in Progress | Released | Work in Progress | Work in Progress | Work in Progress |

Now, upon purging, all the versions except V3, V4, V7, and V10 are purged as per the criteria and the following versions remain after purging. It doesn't matter if we have selected to keep the last three or the last five under the selection criteria.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | V3 | V4 |  |  | V7 |  |  | V10 |
|  |  | Rev A | Rev A |  |  | Rev B |  |  | Rev C |
|  |  | For Review | Released |  |  | Released |  |  | Work in Progress |

### Vault Gateway

# Vault Gateway

Learn how to connect remotely to Vault with Vault Gateway.

## What is Autodesk Vault Gateway?

In this era of remote work, we all need faster and better ways to access data from anywhere, on any device. Vault Gateway makes collaboration easier than ever by continuing to deliver a more modern, connected, and insightful experience. It provides secure remote access to users working remotely. As a result, remote users can create and manage design data in Vault and enjoy the same experience as in the office without needing VPN access.

## How does it work?

Vault Gateway technology securely connects remote devices to Vault servers through a cloud service. The Vault Gateway service generates a URL in place of the Vault server name when logging into the Vault client software (e.g., Vault Client, Add-ins, etc). The cloud service interfaces with the Vault server, exchanging data between the client and server in real time. Vault data is not stored in the Vault Gateway; the data passes through the gateway.

Vault Gateway services locations originate in the continental United States and Europe (Ireland) and now expanded to the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region to connect those geographically distant from the gateway data centre.

Configuring and using Vault Gateway doesn't require any of the following network resources:

* Connection to an on-premise network
* Connection to a VPN
* Opened inbound network ports

The gateway connection is easy to set up, taking minutes from within the Autodesk Data management console. Let's get started.

## Configuring Vault Gateway

Vault Gateway is configured on top of your Vault Server, allowing you to connect external parties into your Vault Server inside your firewall without having to give access through VPN or giving external access to your server through HTTPS.

**Pre-requisites**

Setting up Vault Gateway requires the following Vault installation and configuration:

* A subscription to Vault Professional with all components installed. Vault 2022.1 is the minimum version required to use Vault Gateway.
* A fully migrated KnowledgeVaultMaster database.
* An Autodesk account that is also an Autodesk Account team administrator.
* The Vault Server's default website needs a site binding configured to allow local HTTP requests on port 80. The localhost address maybe 127.0.0.1 (IPv4) or ::1 (IPv6), depending on your TCP/IP protocol version.

## Managing Vault Gateway

Administrators configure gateways for individual [Autodesk Account teams](https://www.autodesk.com/support/technical/article/caas/tsarticles/ts/2OXXxN6ZbF0Hb3FsPR1uHB.html). A Vault administrator must manage at least one Autodesk Account team to configure a gateway.

To manage your team's gateway:

1. In the ADMS Console, select **Tools** in the menu bar.
2. Select **Manage Vault Gateway**. If you're not signed in, you are prompted to sign into an administrator account.
3. The Autodesk Account Teams window displays if you manage multiple teams. Select a team and click OK. The Vault Gateways window displays.

   Note: The Vault Gateways window is the primary dashboard for your team's gateways. It shows information for the local gateway that you manage and other gateways for your team. Click Refresh to update the status of the local gateway and the list of other gateways.
4. In the Vault Gateway window,

   1. Click **Configure** to add a Vault Gateway.

      Fill in the following fields in the Configure Local Gateway window:

      * **Region**: Select the region closest to the physical location of your Vault server.

        Note: A gateway's region can't be edited after the gateway is configured.
      * **Service Account**: The Autodesk ID associated with the gateway. Click Service Account to sign into an account.

        Note: The service account must have a Vault Professional license and be part of the team selected in step 3 above. Additionally, a service account can only be associated with a single gateway.
   2. Click **Delete** to delete the local gateway. To delete a gateway in the Other Gateways section, select the X icon in the Action column to delete the corresponding gateway.
   3. Click **Proxy Server** to set a proxy for the local gateway.

      In the Configure Proxy Server dialog,

      * Select the Enable Proxy check box.
      * Enter the address of the proxy server.
      * If the proxy server requires authentication, select Enable Proxy Authentication check box and enter the username and password the proxy server requires for authentication.
   4. Click **Pause** to stop access to the gateway URL.
   5. Click **Resume** to restore access to the gateway URL.

Once your administrator configures the Vault Gateway, team members can use the gateway URL to connect to their vault remotely.

## Connecting to a Vault Gateway

Logging into a gateway follows the same procedure as [logging into a vault](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-FB74EFDB-718F-4181-81F5-A9E7DF44210D) through a direct server connection. The Server field takes an HTTPS URL to the gateway (a gateway's hostname, displayed when an administrator manages a gateway) instead of a server name.

Note: To activate Vault Gateway, allow outbound HTTP traffic with *.autodesk.com in the firewall. To allow Vault Server firewalls to operate correctly, allow outbound HTTPS traffic with \*.autodesk.com in the firewall. Here is a typical gateway format: \**<https://01e6fc7f.vg.autodesk.com>\*\*.

![](../images/screenshot-vault-gateway-https-required.png)

Note: The Gateway connection allows authentication to the vault using Vault accounts and Autodesk IDs. It doesn't support logging in with Windows authentication as you are not connected to your organization's network.

Your account password must satisfy Vault Gateway's password complexity requirements to sign in. Passwords must contain eight or more characters, with at least one number and letter.

### Access Your Data with the Vault Mobile App

# Access Your Data with the Vault Mobile App

Have you ever needed to access design and engineering data while on the job site or away from your workstation? The Vault mobile app allows you to work with your design and engineering data on your mobile device anywhere, anytime.

## Overview

The Vault mobile app is a companion app to the Vault desktop client; it does not replace the Vault desktop client. The application is available for iOS and Android devices and provides access to a subset of the functionality available in the desktop version of Autodesk Vault. With Vault mobile, you can view, search, and share vault data from your mobile devices, including engineering designs, documents, and other data.

In addition, the app includes collaboration tools that enable you to share and collaborate on Vault data with other team members. Many document consumers need to access vaulted data. Document consumers may not have a dedicated workstation to access vaulted data, so accessing the Vault on mobile devices makes it easier. You can take the Vault to your colleagues on the shop floor to collaborate on a design for manufacture or take while off-site to your customer for a design review.

The Vault mobile app helps you to create a new change order directly from your mobile device. You can add a record or attachment to the change order. You can securely track and control the data when away from your workstation.

### Copy Design

# Copy Design

Learn about how to create new design objects by copying existing data within a vault.

Copy design allows you to copy, copy to a new location, rename, reuse, and replace parts and drawings from any working folder in the vault. Copy Design can be used on any file format saved in the vault allowing the copying and renaming of standard documents to kick start a project.

Copy Design is one of the most powerful features of Autodesk Vault. Engineers are leveraging existing designs by reusing them to save design time or by copying and updating an existing design to reduce design time. Besides the reduced modeling time, design reuse impacts the cost and time savings in downstream engineering, manufacturing, and purchasing.

Let's get into the details of the Copy Design feature.

Depending on which design application you are using, copying a design involves copying a drawing and its related files, copying an entire design structure along with the related 2D drawings for 3D models, or copying components of a design.

## How to access Copy Design?

You can access Copy Design in the Vault Client, the Inventor, or AutoCAD add-ins or launch the stand-alone application.

* Vault Client
  Perform one of the following tasks to launch Copy Design in the Vault Client.

  + Select the top-level assembly drawing and right-click to select the Copy Design command.
  + Right-click on a file or group of files in the main view and select Copy Design.
  + Select a file or group of files in the main view and click Edit > Copy Design.
* Inventor and AutoCAD Add-in
* Stand-Alone Application

  Go to Start > Autodesk > Autodesk Copy Design <release>

Note: If you access Copy Design from the Start menu, you must log in using your username and password.

## Interface

Copy Design is a modeless dialog with a toolbar. It remains open while you use the Vault client for other commands as well as add files to be copied.

Copy Design has three significant areas in the interface - Toolbar, Main View, and Navigation Panel.

![](../images/copydesign-interface-hyt2023.2.png)

The selected files appear in the Main grid, allowing you to select the files and right-click to manage how they are used. When a file is selected and set to a function, it appears in the right panel (navigation panel). You can check and amend the file using right-click on the selected file.

You can also select multiple files by holding down the shift key. See [Shortcut keys](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-4BE3063A-87E9-4B7A-9D64-BC67DC93C116) available for all options in the Copy Design dialog.

## Menus and Toolbar

The toolbar consists of the File, View, Actions, Options, and Help menus.

See [Copy Design Interface](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-9865E786-4FE2-40AC-B951-1FEBA910ECCC) for details on each operation you can perform under these menus.

## Main View

The main grid displays information about the files on which you can perform the Copy Design operation. You can set a specific action on each file displayed in the grid. See Copy Design actions that you can perform on files in the Copy Design dialog.

You can change the view by clicking the View -> Layout menu. There are three different layouts:

* **Tree View**: Displays the assembly in an organized configuration showing the assembly's hierarchy and associated files in the copy process. It enables you to understand the relationship of all files involved in the copy process.
* **List View**: Displays all the files associated with the file selected in the copy process.
* **Folder View**: Displays the destination folder where the new files are placed after the copy process is complete.

You can also customize how the main grid looks. See Customize the View for more information.

Here is a table showing the feature list and the various views:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *Feature* | *Tree View* | *List View* | *Folder view* |
| Find | x |  | x |
| Find & Replace | x |  | x |
| Edit the File Name | x | x | x |

| Set Copy Action | x | x | x |
| Drag & Drop to Numbering Panel | x |  | x |
| Column Filtering |  | x |  |
| Grouping |  | x |  |

## Right Panel (Navigation Panel)

The right panel has the Numbering panel shown by default. Select View > Panels to display the hidden panels.

* Numbering Panel - Lists all the files selected for the copy operation. It also shows the original and new file names for each selected file. You can also edit certain fields and individual numbering schemes.
* Hidden Panels:

  + Folders Panel - Review the source and destination folders for the copy design operation.
  + Where Used Panel - Track the copy objects' origin and destination.
  + Actions Panel - Review which operations are assigned to be performed on files in the main view.

![](../images/copydesign-panels-hyt2023.2.png)

The features in these panels can also be performed in the main grid. See Copy Design Interface for more information.

## Set Reuse Library Files in Vault Copy Design

You can set reuse library files to drive design reuse.

By default, the option “Show Children” > Library Files” in the View menu is set to ON. This setting persists in the Copy Design dialog.

To **Reuse Branch Library Files**

1. Open the Copy Design dialog and ensure the “Show Children” > “Library Files” option in the View menu is selected.
2. Select a branch in the Copy Design.
3. Right-click on the branch row or choose Actions menu
4. Select the “Reuse Branch Library Files” action.

Following these steps, all library files in the selected branch will be set to reuse.

To **Reuse All Library Files**

1. Open the Copy Design dialog and ensure the “Show Children” > “Library Files” in the View menu is selected.
2. Select Actions menu
3. Select the “Reuse All Library Files” action.

After performing these steps, all library files in the main grid will be set to reuse.

Note: In the Copy Design, blank value for Action Column means the file is reused.

## Copy Design Actions

The following list describes the actions you can perform on files in the Copy Design dialog.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Copy All | Sets the Copy action on all files in the Copy Design dialog. |
| Copy Top Nodes | Sets the Copy action on all files at the top node in the Copy Design dialog. |
| Copy | Sets the Copy action on all selected files. Hold the Ctrl key to select multiple files at once. |
| Copy To | Sets the Copy action on all selected files, and the selected files are placed in the specified folder. Note: The original folder structure is not maintained for files with this action. |
| Copy Branch | Sets the Copy action on the selected files and the entire file structure (branch) beneath it. |
| Copy Branch To | Sets the Copy action on the selected files and the entire file structure (branch) beneath and sets the destination path to the specified folder. Note: When the copy operation completes, the copied files are placed in a specific folder maintaining the original folder structure. |
| Reuse | Sets the Reuse action on the selected files. The selected files are reused instead of creating a copy. This is a great way to minimize duplicates of a file that must be used in more than one location of a design. |
| Reuse Library Files | You can set the reuse action for the selected library file by using the action in the right-click menu. When this action is used, the selected library file initially set to copy will now be set to reuse.  Note: In the new Copy Design, blank value for Action Column means the file is reused. This action is available in the right-click menu. However, it can only be accessed when a library file is selected. |
| Reuse All Library Files | This action will set all copied library files to reuse in the main grid. |
| Reuse All | All files in the Copy Design dialog are set to Reuse. |
| Reuse Branch | Sets the Reuse action to the selected file and the entire file structure beneath it. |
| Reuse Branch Library Files | This action will set all copied library files to reuse in the selected branch.  Note: This action is available in the right-click menu. However, it can only be accessed when a branch library file is selected. |
| Replace | Replaces the selected file with the specified file. The name of the original file changes to the replacement file's name. |
| Exclude | Sets the Exclude action on the selected files. This action can only be used on parent documentation files. If this is set on any other file in the structure, that file is reused during the copy operation. |
| Go To | You can go to the original file in the Vault Client using the Source Folder option. After the Copy operation, you can go to the newly copied file in the Vault client using the Destination option. |

## Copy Design Options

Copy Design has several settings which affect the copy process. Let's take a look at these options.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Numbering Schemes | Select Numbering Schemes to set which naming schemes are valid for use in your copy design configuration. |
| Action Rules | Select to create, edit, and delete rules that apply to your copy operations. Each Rule Set contains several file behavior and property settings that can be applied to the copied file based on the source file. |
| Always Reuse Library files | By default, this option is turned off. When it is off, the Copy action on the library file node is available. The copy branch action will set the library files to copy, meaning the library files are not reused.    When this option is turned on, library files are reused, even if they were set to copy before enabling this option. The Copy action on the library file node becomes unavailable, and the copy branch action will not set the library files to copy.    Note: This option selection is cached and maintained on the local client machine. |
| Automatically Copy Parents | When this option is turned on, the parent of each copied component is also copied. Disabling this option results in source assemblies being edited to include the new copied part. |
| Link Drawings with Models | When selected, the drawing connected to a model is copied to the same location and shares the same new file name as the model. |
| Remove All Attachments | When selected, all attachments are removed from the newly created files. By default, all file attachments are attached to the new file. |
| Select References | By default, all component references are copied. When this option is turned on, you can choose which references of a component are copied. |
| Remove All BOM Objects | Remove All BOM Objects - When this option is turned on, the BOM information inside of newly created files is removed during the copy operation.  Note: These files are not assigned to an item until they are updated inside of the CAD application. |
| Manage Distributed Option | Select the Manage Distributed Options to set which options to distributed in your copy design configuration. You can also reset the options.    Note: You must have an "Administrator" or "Configuration Administrator" role to manage and deploy distributed options. |
| Configure Prompts | Select the Configure Prompts to configure the default response for Stand-alone Copy Design dialogs, so that every time certain dialogs are displayed, your preferred response is the default selection.    You can also specify which commands for Stand-alone Copy Design are automatically performed without prompting you for input, reducing the number of times you need to directly interact with the Stand-alone Copy Design dialogs.    Note: This option is only for Stand-alone Copy Design. |

See [Copy Design Interface - Options](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-9865E786-4FE2-40AC-B951-1FEBA910ECCC) for details of how they are used.

## Action Rules

Action Rule sets are a collection of rules which define property behaviors on newly created files during the copy process. Rule sets can be used to reset the category of a target file, map file properties, or clear or reset file properties.

Only one rule set can be applied to the selected data set during a copy operation. For this reason, a rule set can contain several rules that determine the settings of multiple file types based on extension, properties, or use.

Note: You must be a Vault Administrator to modify Action Rules.

To create, edit, or delete Action Rule Sets:

* In the toolbar, click Options > Action Rules > Define to open the Action Rules dialog.

  ![](../images/copydesign-actionruleset-hyt2023.2.png)
* Click **New** to define an Action Rule Set. See Define an Action Rule Set for more information.

Note:

* While editing a rule within a rule set, define the condition a rule must meet before the property behaviors are executed. If multiple conditions are defined for a rule, all conditions must be met before the property behaviors are executed.
* All rules in a rule set are run in priority order from top to bottom. The first rule in which the condition is met is executed on a file; the subsequent rules are not checked on the same file.

## Copy Design Walkthrough

Let's now go through a typical copy design workflow.

Pre-requisite:

* Configure [Copy Design options](#copy-design-options) settings.

Perform the following steps:

1. In the Vault Client, right-click on the file you want to copy and select Copy Design.

   If you want to copy a particular version of a file, right-click on the version from the History tab and select Copy Design.

   ![](../images/copydesign-historicalversion-hyt2023.2.png)

   Click **Add Files** ![](../images/icon-add-files.png) from the **File** menu on the toolbar to add additional files for copying. Select the files that you want to copy and click Open. The files are added to the [main view](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-9865E786-4FE2-40AC-B951-1FEBA910ECCC) of the Copy Design dialog.

   ![](../images/copydesign-addfiles-hyt2023.2.png)

   **Tip**: Click Refresh at any time to capture the latest version of the listed files and file structure.
2. Select the file that you want to copy, right-click on the file and select the [action](#copy-design-actions) from the context menu.

   Alternatively, select the file that you want to copy, click Actions in the Toolbar, and then select the [action](#copy-design-actions) to be performed.

   ![](../images/copydesign-copyactions-hyt2023.2.png)
3. Click **Execute Copy** ![](../images/icon-execute-copy.png) on the toolbar to start the copy operation.

   ![](../images/copydesign-executecopy-hyt2023.2.png)

   Several pre-checks are performed to ensure that:

   * All files have unique names (by Folder)
   * Vault unique file name rules are met
   * Selected files still exist
   * Files requiring edits are write-enabled
   * Files requiring edits are owned by the workgroup site

   All successful copy operations receive a green check in the main view. If a copy operation failed, a red cross is displayed. Hover over the red cross icon on each highlighted row to view the warning detail. You can export the restricted file list to an external file (xls, xlsx, txt, htm, html) for reference.

   To perform another copy operation, modify your settings and click Execute Copy.

## Copy Design Report

Once a Copy Design operation is complete, you can generate a report which shows the operation performed.

1. Click File > Export.
2. Select a file name, file type, and destination folder to save the report.

Only columns shown in the dialog at the time of the operation are exported in the report.

### Lifecycle Administration - States, Versions, and Revisions

# Lifecycle Administration - States, Versions, and Revisions

Learn about how to make lifecycles work for your design environment.

A lifecycle administration allows you to streamline your work environment by removing the overhead involved in managing groups of files, custom objects, or an entire project. Here in this article, we'll show you how to take your designs from one state to another using Vault Lifecycles.

The **lifecycle state** represents a certain point in the lifecycle of vault data (e.g., Work in Progress, Review, or Released).

**Versions** are created automatically in Vault with each Check in and State change. Therefore, each version is a point in history.

With **revisions**, you can label a significant milestone or set of changes to a document and its related files. The label itself is the revision and the collection of files affected in that revision are considered a revision level. A revision level can be retrieved later so that a document and the version of the related files associated with that particular revision are preserved.

**Lifecycle definition** is an engine that can be configured to automatically assign security, behaviors, and properties to Vault objects based on where the object is in the life of the design process.

Note: Users with specific permissions can create Lifecycle Definitions.

A lifecycle definition uses states to identify the object's status in the lifecycle. For example, let's take a simple engineering process where lifecycle states include work-in-progress, review, and released.

An object moves from one state to another based on the lifecycle definition's transition rules. These transition rules determine when the state change happens if it can occur manually or automatically (or both), based on criteria specified by the administrator. For example, a lifecycle definition can be configured to automatically revise a file when it moves from one state to another. Or, if a user changes a folder's status to obsolete, the lifecycle definition can automatically apply security settings to the folder so that only an administrator can modify the folder and its contents or reinstate it for use.

![](../images/lifecycleadministration-hyt2023.1.png)

In the above diagram, the object version keeps incrementing when working in the Work in Progress state or the Released state (Revision A with Versions 1 to 8). When the object moves from Released to Work in Progress state; there is a Revision bump from A to B. So the version keeps incrementing with each checkin or state change, and the Revision increments as per the transition rule.

## Prerequisite

* Assign a Category to the Lifecycle definition.

  Category lets you automatically assign a defined set of behaviors and rules to objects. Any object that is not specifically assigned to a category will be assigned to the default category determined for that entity class. To create a category, see Create a Category.

## Assumption

* A revision scheme is assigned to the Category.

  Categories are assigned revision schemes, which are then applied to files and items assigned to that category. To assign one or more revision schemes to a category, see Assign Revision Schemes to Categories.

  To create a new revision scheme and customize the settings for your design process, see Create a Revision Scheme. Revision management provides consistency throughout the product lifecycle by applying a common definition and behavior to files and items in a vault. Revision schemes are used to manage versioning during product development.

## Setting up a Lifecycle Definition

Once you have defined the category and assigned a revision scheme to the category, perform the following steps.

1. Create a Lifecycle Definition.

   Create a new lifecycle definition and select the category to which the lifecycle definition must apply. Refer to the topic Create a Lifecycle Definition.
2. Add Lifecycle States to a lifecycle to meet your design process needs.

   * In the Lifecycle Definition dialog, add the lifecycle states to define your workflow.
   * Enter the name, color, and description for the new state (e.g., Work In Progress).
   * Repeat these steps to create all the states (Design Check, Review, Released) in the workflow.

   Refer to the topic Add a Lifecycle State to a Lifecycle.
3. For each lifecycle state, you need to configure state security, control options, and transition settings.

   | Member | Security | Control | Transition |
   | --- | --- | --- | --- |
   | CAD Administrators/ Designers/ Engineers/ Managers/ Manufacturing… | Set member permissions (Read/Modify/Delete - Allow/Deny/None) | Configure purge preference  (All/First and Last/Last/None | * Define criteria when a state transition can occur. * Set an event to take place when a state transition occurs. For instance, an automatic revision bump. * Set members (users/groups) that can execute a transition. * Set control permissions. |

   1. **Security tab**

      Define State security to configure who can do what within each state. For example, it controls which members and groups can read, modify, or delete an object assigned to a state.

      * Specify the members that will have a role within the selected state. To do this:

        + Uncheck "No state-based security".
        + Select Add to specify which member can read, modify, or delete. Next, select members from the Available Members list and click "Add" to move them under Current Members.
      * Select the Allow, Deny, or  permission for the Read, Modify, and Delete columns for each member. See Access Control Lists for more information about permissions.

        | Permission | Access |
        | --- | --- |
        | Read | + Allow-States can be viewed. + Deny-States cannot be viewed. If a member is denied read access, then they are not allowed Modify or Delete access either. + None-State cannot be viewed. |
        | Modify | + Allow-States can be modified. + Deny-State cannot be modified. + None-State cannot be modified. |
        | Delete | + Allow-State can be deleted. + Deny-State cannot be deleted. + None-State cannot be deleted. |

      As a best practice, apply security to Groups (not individual users) for easy administration.

      For more information, see [Edit Lifecycle State Security](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-EEC9F632-6ED8-4671-8487-69436A0E1AD0).
   2. **Control tab**

      Configure your purge preferences for files assigned to a lifecycle definition to help manage Vault file retention. Controlled file versions protect the specific document versions in the corresponding state from being purged.

      1. Select the checkbox to set the state as Released or Obsolete.

         Note: The system will always retain at least one version of a file with a released state.
      2. Select one of the following options:

         * All - No versions in this state are removed when a purge is performed. This option is recommended for states where not many versions are created or where each version is critical.
         * First and Last - All versions in this state are removed during a purge, except the first and last versions in each series. Use this option for states where the changes between the first and last files are helpful.
         * Last - All versions in this state are removed during a purge, except the last version in each series. This option is recommended for states where a record that the file was in the state is essential.
         * None - No version in this state will be retained after the purge has been performed, except versions will be retained if they are consumed by a parent file.
      3. Check the Include existing files versions box to apply purge restriction for lifecycle states for existing versions of files.

         Note: If this box is not checked, then the purge version control settings apply only to new file versions.

      For more information, see [Edit Lifecycle State Control](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-02294D64-9ACA-4546-956E-095D9D7814B1).
   3. **Transitions tab**

      When an object moves from one lifecycle state to the next, it is called a transition. For example, when a file in the Work in Progress state is changed to a Released state, that is a state transition. Transitions link lifecycle states together in a process. By default, all states link to all other states. For each state, select transition and select Edit.

      1. Select the state and click Edit.
      2. In the Transition dialog, for each state transition in a lifecycle, you can configure the criteria, transition event, permission to execute the transition. Select the respective tabs to configure the transition settings.

         * Criteria - Configure the property criteria that determine when a state transition can occur. For example, administrators can make it so that a file cannot transition to the next state without the Initial Approver property having a value.
         * Actions that occur when the transition is made - Configure which events automatically take place when a successful transition occurs. For instance, select the checkbox "Bump primary revision" to bump the revision to the next revision in the sequence when transitioning from the Released state to the Work in Progress state.
         * Security - Determine the members that can execute a transition and set access control permissions (Allow/Deny).

           Note:

           + If only specific members are allowed to perform a transition between the two states, add Transition security of "Allow" for the appropriate member.
           + If the desired workflow doesn't have a direct path between the two states, set the transition security to "Everyone Deny".

      For more information, see Edit Lifecycle State Transitions.

## Configure Settings for Vault Operations

# Configure Settings for Vault Operations

The Settings feature allows you to configure your relationship, attachment, and extraction preferences.

The Settings feature can be accessed on dialogs displayed during certain vault operations, such as Check-in, Change State, and Pack and Go.

![](../images/settings-dialog-vault-operations.png)

Note: The options available on the Settings dialog depend on the vault operation being performed.

## Relationship Options

Specify whether only the children of the file, the parents of the file, or all related files are included in the vault operation. Vault Professional users can also decide whether to include linked objects.

* Select the Include dependents check box to apply the vault operation to all files on which the selected file depends.
* Select the Include attachments check box to apply the vault operation to all files attached to the selected file.
* Select the Include library files check box to include any parent/children files in the library folders. The Include dependents or Include attachments check box must be enabled for this parameter to work.
* Select the Include Parents check box to apply the vault operation to all files that depend on the selected file. Turn on Direct Parents Only to include only the files that depend on the selected file within one level.
* Select the Include related documentation check box to apply the vault operation to specially designated files, such as IPN and IDW files. When used in conjunction with the Include dependents or Include Parents check boxes, the vault operation will apply to files related to the dependent or parent files as well, respectively.
* Select the Include Links option to include linked files or files associated with a linked object in the check in. Select which types of linked objects you want to include from the Include links drop-down.

  The data associated with the linked objects are not included in the selection set. Refer to [Project Links](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-6BB2511B-FAE7-4C33-919A-E8AD09D47634) for more information.

## DWF Attachment Options

* Turn on the Create DWF Attachment check box to create and attach a .dwf file to the design being added or checked into the vault. This option is on by default.
* Turn on the Apply to All Files check box to create .dwf attachments for all files being added or checked into the vault. This option must be turned on to create .dwf files for children.


## Go to Vault (add-ins-only)

# Go to Vault (add-ins-only)

Although the Autodesk Vault add-in supports many essential vault functions from within the parent application's environment, it may be necessary to launch the Autodesk Vault Stand-Alone client to access additional vault administration and file maintenance options.

You can launch the Autodesk Vault stand-alone client straight from the Vault ribbon.

* Select Go to Vault from the Vault ribbon to launch the Autodesk Vault client.


## Go to Vault Folder

# Go to Vault Folder

Note: This feature is only available in the Inventor and AutoCAD Vault Add-in (available-in-autocad-mechanical,-autocad-electrical,-and-autocad-map).

You can go directly to a file in Vault from within Inventor and AutoCAD using the Go to Vault Folder command.

* In Inventor, right-click a file in the Vault browser or in the Inventor model browser, and then select Go to Vault Folder.
* In AutoCAD, right click a file in the External References palette and select Go to Vault Folder.

A Vault Client session opens showing the file with its version and revision and inside its stored project location. A new Vault Client session opens even though an existing session is running.


## Working Folders

# Working Folders

The files stored in a vault cannot be directly edited. When files are checked out or when you get versions of files from a vault, the files are copied from the vault to a local folder called the working folder.

You can browse the working folder, specify a different working folder, or set up a shared working folder for multiple users.

## Understand Working Folders

The working folder contains read-only copies of files that have not been checked out from a vault. When a file is checked out, the checked out version from the vault replaces the file in the working folder and becomes read-write for editing. When the file is checked back into the vault, the local version in the working folder returns to read-only.

A working folder location is defined by default, allowing you to begin working with a vault right away. The default working folder is:

* My Documents\Vault

If you are using Civil 3D, the default working folder is:

* C:\Civil 3D Projects

Important: Do not move files from the local working folder after they have been checked out. Files checked out to the working folder must always be checked back into the vault from the same working folder.

## Browse the Working Folder

The local working folder must already be specified to browse content in a vault.

* In the Autodesk Vault client, right-click a folder in the tree view, and then select Browse. The contents of the selected folder are displayed in a Microsoft Windows Explorer window.

### Set the Working Folder

# Set the Working Folder

The working folder contains read-only copies of files that have been checked out from a vault.

When a file is checked out, the checked out version from the vault replaces the file in the working folder and becomes read-write for editing. When the file is checked back into the vault, the local version in the working folder returns to read-only.

It is not necessary to specify a working folder to begin using a vault since one is defined by default at My Documents\Vault. However, you can change the location for the working folder with the Set Working Folder command. Administrators can also enforce a standard working folder location for all users.

Note: Custom working folder locations are overridden when an administrator enforces a standard working folder location.

Each vault has a root level folder. The root level of a vault is denoted by a $.

![](../images/diagram-workingfolder.png)

**Set the Working Folder**

1. Select a file or folder in the vault.

   Tip: As a best practice, set the working folder location from the root ($) level of the vault.

   Note: The working folder must be set from the root ($) level of the vault to a local folder for AutoCAD and AutoCAD Mechanical files. The Vault add-in for AutoCAD ignores working folders that are not set at the root ($).
2. Select File > Set Working Folder.

   ![](../images/menu-setworkingfolder.png)
3. In the Browse for Folder dialog box, navigate to the new location on the local computer for the working folder.
4. Click OK.

If the application option is enabled, the working folder path displays above the vault folder tree and the file list.

**Parent page:** [Working Folders](GUID-E9B067D1-227C-4DEA-934E-7AF090C4EAC6.htm)


### Share a Working Folder

# Share a Working Folder

Each user has a unique working folder, isolated from other users. However, depending on your design requirements, you can specify a working folder on a shared network drive that is accessed by all users.

In a multi-user environment, a shared working folder keeps all the working files consistently located in the same working folder. This prevents the lag between the upload to the server by one user and the subsequent download to all other users.

Note: A shared working folder is recommended for the AutoCAD Electrical environment, especially in a multi-user situation, because it enables you and your design team to keep all files up-to-date.

A shared workspace can be used with:

* Autodesk Vault
* The Vault Add-in for AutoCAD-based design applications
* The Vault Add-in for Microsoft Office

## Rules for Using a Shared Working Folder

Using a shared working folder means that multiple users may be working on the same files concurrently.

* All users must log into the vault before performing any file operations.
* You cannot perform the following actions on a file that is checked out to another user:

  + Get Latest Version
  + Get Previous Version
  + Check Out
  + Undo Check Out
  + Reload (autocad-add-in-only)
* You can view files as read-only that are checked out to another user as long as they use the same working folder.

## Set up a Shared Working Folder

The system administrator enforces a working folder on a shared network location for all project members to use.

Note: You must be assigned the role of Administrator to perform this action.

1. Launch Autodesk Vault and then log in as an administrator.
2. Select Tools > Administration > Vault Settings.
3. In the Vault Settings dialog, click the Files tab.
4. In the Working Folder section, click Define.
5. In the Working Folder Options dialog, select Enforce consistent working folder for all clients.

   ![](../images/dialog-working-folder-options.png)
6. Specify the shared network location for the working folder in the Client Working Folder field or browse to a location.

   Note: The path to the shared working folder can be:

   * a network path: \\designco\users\jstewart
   * a path containing a system variable for a directory: \\designco\users\%username%
7. Click OK.
8. In the Vault Settings dialog, click Close.

### Synchronizing Your Workspace

# Synchronizing Your Workspace

There are three different methods to help you synchronize your workspace and keep the local file structure up-to-date.

Note: This feature is available in Vault Professional.

When you get or check out files, files are copied from the vault to your local working folder, also known as your workspace. Over time, your workspace may accumulate files that are no longer necessary or stray files that are not meant to be managed by a vault. These files can be cleaned up by synchronizing your workspace.

## Synchronization Methods

There are three methods for synchronizing your workspace:

* **[Workspace Sync](GUID-0CE7940A-FB90-436D-9E95-9FD283F048FD.htm)** –before synchronizing, you must select which local files are synchronized. You can also specify more advanced settings such as expiration dates and file exceptions
* **[Quick Sync](GUID-CAEA516A-3A83-44ED-BC2E-8329269CB08A.htm)** –synchronizes the files immediately, using the default settings.
* **[Sync from the Command Line](GUID-819572A5-BE9A-4A40-AFCD-BB635B6DEFC4.htm)** –synchronizes files by creating an event in the Windows Task Scheduler to automate workspace synchronization.

### Synchronization Settings

By adjusting [synchronization settings](GUID-66BADCA3-5CC5-46DC-9770-38D9D8C4C511.htm), you can specify:

* which files in the workspace are automatically deleted
* an expiration date for local files
* whether or not empty folders are removed

Note: Mapping multiple vaults to the same working folder is not supported.

#### Workspace Sync

# Workspace Sync

Use the Workspace Sync command to clean unnecessary files from the workspace and keep it up to date.

Note: This feature is available in Vault Professional.

The Workspace Sync command compares the contents of the workspace with the contents of the corresponding vault to verify which files need to be updated either in the workspace or in the vault and which files need to be removed from the workspace.

Depending on your settings, the last modified date, the current revision, or the current revision with released biased is used to determine whether or not a file needs to be updated.

Note: Workspace sync does not support a working folder set at the root of a drive (for example, D:\). If you attempt to sync with a root-level folder, sync will fail with an error similar to: "Access to the path {system folder} is denied".

**Synchronize Your Workspace**

Select which files to synchronize with these steps:

1. In the Vault Client, select Workspace Sync from the WorkSpace Sync drop-down menu on the toolbar.

   ![](../images/icon-workspacesync.png)
2. Select Tools > Workspace Sync to launch the Workspace Synchronization Wizard.

   The local workspace is scanned to determine which files need to be updated or removed. The files that will be synchronized are displayed.
3. Specify the files that you want synchronized by selecting the check box next to each file. If you do not want a file synchronized, clear the check box beside that file. The total number of files to be removed and the total number of files to be downloaded are displayed at the bottom of the wizard.

   * **Download - New**: if the parent of a file is updated and the new version or revision uses a file that is not in the local workspace, the file not in the local workspace is retrieved from the vault.
   * **Download - Overwrite**: the files currently in the local workspace that will be updated with new versions or revisions from the vault, depending on your settings. If the local file is currently locked because it is open for editing, it is not overwritten.
   * **Expired - Unmanaged:** files in the local workspace that are not managed by the vault and have not been modified within the expiration time frame specified in Workspace Sync Settings.
   * **Expired - Managed**: files in the local workspace that are managed by the vault but which have not been modified within the expiration time frame specified in Workspace Sync Settings.
   * **Expired - Hidden**: hidden visualization files in the local workspace that are managed by the vault but which have not been modified within the expiration time frame specified in the Workspace Sync Settings dialog.

   Note: Removed files are placed in the Windows Recycle Bin.
4. Click Settings to specify update preferences, which file extensions to delete, and expiration rules.
5. Click Finish. The local workspace is synchronized using the specified settings.
6. When the synchronization is complete, the results are summarized in a report. The report lists those files which were successfully downloaded and those which were successfully removed, as well as the files which unsuccessfully synchronized.
7. You can generate a report as a (.csv) file and save it locally or in the vault, or print it by performing one of these options:

   * To save the report locally, click Save. On the Save As dialog, navigate to the folder structure where you want to store the file locally. Enter a name for the report and click Save.
   * To save the report in a vault, Click Send to Vault to display a list of vault folders. Select the vault in which you want the report saved, enter a name for the report, and click Save.
   * To print the report, click Print and specify your printing options.
8. Click Close.

#### Synchronize Your Workspace from the Command Line

# Synchronize Your Workspace from the Command Line

Run workspace synchronization from the command line.

Using the command line, you can create a script or an event in Windows Task Scheduler to automate workspace synchronization.

Note: By default, the file delete option is suppressed when synchronizing your workspace from the command line. This is to prevent any inadvertent loss of data. To enable file delete via the command line, you must edit the XML file and enable this functionality:

```
<StandAloneOnlySettingDeleteFiles>=True
```

1. Click Windows Start > Run, and then enter cmd in the Run dialog box.
2. Change directories to the install directory for Autodesk Vault. By default, this path is C:\Program Files\Autodesk\Autodesk Vault [version]\Explorer.
3. At the command line, type: Connectivity.WorkspaceSync.exe followed by the command line options, and then press Enter.

   | Command | Details |
   | --- | --- |
   | -WA | Use Windows authentication to log into the Vault server (optional). |
   | -N*server*\*databasename* | The name of the server and the database to be synchronized (required). |
   | -VU*username* | The user name of the vault account. (This flag is optional if Windows authentication is used. It is required if the Windows authentication flag is not used). |
   | -VP*password* | The vault account password (required unless password is blank). |
   | -S | The full path to a valid synchronization settings file (optional). The synchronization settings file specifies the syncrhonization options. For more information on exporting a settings file, see Specify Workspace Sync Settings. |
   | -F | The full path and file name for a report file (optional). The synchronization summary is written to the report file. If the report file already exists, the summary is appended to the contents of the existing file. |

   **Examples**

   * Connectivity.WorkspaceSync.exe -Ndmserver\Vault -WA -S"C:\Synchronization Settings\Settings.xml" -FC:\temp\SyncReport.csv
   * Connectivity.WorkspaceSync.exe -Ndmserver\Vault -VUbkeaton -VPg3nEral27 -S"C:\Synchronization Settings\Settings.xml" -FC:\temp\SyncReport.csv

   Note: Paths containing spaces must be inside of double quotes (for example, "C:\Synchronization Settings\Settings.xml").

   ![](../images/dialog-workspace-sync-settings.png)

## Update file in Workspace

The Update file in Workspace area lets you determine whether you want to update files to the latest version, current revision, or current revision with released bias.

1. Select one of the following update options:

   * Latest Version
   * Current Revision
2. If you select Current Revision, select the Released Bias check box to favor released revisions over non-released ones when performing a synchronization.

## Auto-delete Filters

You can specify which file types that are not managed by the vault are automatically deleted from the workspace. Any file in the working folder matching the file extensions specified will be deleted during synchronization. Two filters are supplied and turned off by default: Log Files (.log) and Acad Backup Files (.bak, ac$).

1. Click Add to create a new delete filter.
2. A new filter named New Delete Filter is added to the list and turned on by default.
3. In the Filter Name field, enter a name for the filter.
4. In the Extensions field, specify which file extensions are associated with the filter. Separate multiple extensions with commas.
5. When activated, the file types specified by the filter will be deleted automatically during synchronization. Turn on the check box next to a filter to activate the filter. Turn off the check box next to a filter to turn of the filter.
6. To remove a filter from the list, select a filter and the click Remove.

Note: A file that would be deleted as a result of an auto-delete filter will not be deleted from a folder if the override is set to Never.

## Expiration Settings

You can set expiration criteria for both files managed by a vault and for files in the workspace that are not managed by a vault.

1. Turn on the Managed Files check box to apply expiration criteria to files in the local workspace that are managed by the vault.
2. Specify a quantity and a duration to determine expired files. Select either days or weeks for the duration.
3. Turn on the Unmanaged Files check box to apply expiration criteria to files in the local workspace that are not managed by the vault. Select either days or weeks for the duration.

   Note: If the duration is set to 0, the expiration time frame is immediate.

## Expiration Overrides

The expiration settings apply to all managed and un-managed files in the local workspace. Expiration overrides can be set for specific files and folders for more focused expiration criteria.

Note: The files that have been deleted from Vault will also be deleted from the local workspace during the workspace synchronization. Excluding the folder from the expired timeframe doesn't prevent this deletion. If you do not want a file synchronized, clear the check box beside that file.

1. Click Add Files to select specific files for which expiration overrides will be set. Click Add Folder to select a specific folder for which expiration overrides will be set. The selected files and folders are displayed in the override list. Select a file or folder from the overrides list and then click Remove to remove the entry from the list.
2. For folders and individual files, you can specify a different duration and time frame from the global expiration settings. Select Never from the Units drop-down menu to prevent the file or folder from ever expiring.

Note: A file that would be deleted as a result of an auto-delete filter will not be deleted from a folder if the override is set to Never.

## Remove Empty Folders

* Turn on the Remove empty folders check box to delete a folder from the local workspace once the last file from it has been removed as a result of synchronizing files.

## Export or Import Synchronization Settings

Synchronization settings can be exported to an .xml file as well as imported from an .xml file. The settings file can then be imported by other users or specified when running workpsace synchronization from the command line.

* Click Export settings to save the current settings in an .xml file. In the Save As dialog, specify a file name and location for the settings file and then click Save.
* Click Import settings to open a workspace synchronization settings .xml file. In the Open dialog, select the .xml file to import and then click Open.

#### View File Relationships

# View File Relationships

Autodesk Vault allows you to use file relationships to affect more than one file with a single command.

There are two types of file relationships:

**Child** A child file depends on another file for property or behavior information.

**Parent** A parent file is a file that other files depend on for property or behavior information.

Use file relationships with commands such as check in, check out, and get latest version to affect one or multiple files at once.

You can also modify files and ensure that those changes are inherited based on the file relationship. For example, you can:

* Change a part or assembly that affects multiple drawings.
* Change a part that affects the parent assembly.

## View File Relationships

You can view different file relationships using view filter buttons on many dialogs, such as Check in. Toggle settings using instant-access buttons.

The **Folder View** ![](../images/icon-folderview.png) button shows files in hierarchal position within the vault.

The **List View** ![](../images/icon-listview.png) button shows all files in a flat list without relationships.

The **Design View** ![](../images/icon-designview.png) button shows a subset of files in a design hierarchy.

#### Insert into CAD

# Insert into CAD

You can insert a file from Vault Client into the current open and active Inventor document.

Note: This feature is available in Vault Professional only.

After you select an Inventor part or assembly, this function automatically locates and downloads the Vault source file and places it into the active Inventor design session.

Note: In order to use the Insert into CAD command, you must have an active Vault project open within Inventor. You must also have an assembly, part, or drawing file open in Inventor.

1. Locate an Inventor part or assembly in Vault Client.
2. Right-click and select Insert into CAD.

The selected file is inserted into the open and active Inventor part, drawing, or assembly file.

#### Open a File from Vault with the Vault Client

# Open a File from Vault with the Vault Client

In the Vault Client, you can specify whether you want to check the file out or not when you open it.

If you check out the file, then you can make edits to it. If you do not check out the file, the file will be read-only.

Perform one of the following actions:

* Select a file and then select File > Open.
* Right-click a file and then select Open from the context menu.

  Note: Vault Client retrieves the latest versions of file dependencies instead of gathering file dependencies based on the file revision.

If the file is in checked-in state, you are prompted to check out the selected file.

* Select **Yes** to check out the file from the vault and open it in the corresponding application

  + You are prompted to update properties of the selected file.
    - Select **Yes** to update the properties of the file after checkout. The file can be edited, and properties will be updated. When you finish editing the file, save the changes and check it back into the vault.
    - Select **No** to not update the properties of the file after checkout. The file still can be edited, but the properties will not be updated. When you finish editing the file, save the changes and check it back into the vault.
* Select **No** to get the file from the vault and open it in the corresponding application without checking it out. The file will be read-only.

Note: If opening Inventor files and there are multiple Inventor project files in the Vault, a "Select project file" dialog can be presented asking to choose which one should be used to locate any referenced files. If you choose a project file that was not used the last time the files were checked into the Vault, further prompts may appear offering to check any referencing files out of the Vault. Vaulting a single Inventor project file will avoid the risk of making unnecessary changes to files.

## Open Drawing from Vault

Use the Open Drawing command in Vault to open the associated drawing file from the Vault Client.

Note: The Open Drawing command is supported in Inventor and SolidWorks only.

1. Select an assembly or a part file.
2. Right-click and select the Open Drawing command.

   * If a single drawing is associated, drawing file is directly opened from Vault.
   * If there are multiple drawing files associated, the "Select a File" dialog displays listing the drawings associated to design file.

**Has Drawing Property**

The "Has Drawing" system property helps to identify whether the object is a drawing or has one or more associated drawings. You can list all objects within a project with missing drawings by searching the "Has Drawing" property. You can also make sure the objects are only released if an associated drawing exists by leveraging the property checkin lifecycle transition.

Note: The Has Drawing property is only true when the current revision has a version that is linked to a drawing.

* True (indicates that the object is a drawing, or has a drawing or an associated drawing file)
* False (indicates that the object has no drawing or an associated drawing file)

#### Open a File from Vault with the AutoCAD Vault Add-in

# Open a File from Vault with the AutoCAD Vault Add-in

Opening a file from the vault opens an existing drawing file from the vault.

To modify a file from the vault, the file must be checked out to you. You can edit it on your local drive.

Local copies that are not checked out are read-only.

Each of the following conditions must be met to open a file from the vault for editing:

* You must be logged into the vault that contains the file you want to edit.
* The file must be in a checked-in state. It cannot be checked out to another user.
* You must have permissions to check out the file for editing.

If the working copy of a file is older than the version in the vault, you are prompted to replace the working copy. If the working copy is currently checked out, it is not replaced.

Note: If a file is not available for editing, you are informed with a message upon checking out the file. Files that are locked cannot be checked out of the vault.

## Open Inventor files with AnyCAD references

AnyCAD for Inventor allows you to reference a part or assembly file that is one year newer than the version you are on. Since AnyCAD files are not part of all the Inventor workflows, these files are skipped during processing to avoid any performance issues. To include AnyCAD files during check in/check out or from the Vault browser, you need to update the files before check in.

Perform the following steps to update AnyCAD files:

1. In the Inventor browser, expand the root AnyCAD node so they become loaded.
2. You can do one of the following:

   * Check out the desired files, or
   * Check out the root of the AnyCAD file and include children, or
   * Checkout the AnyCAD files in the Vault Browser.
3. Overwrite the local copy with new ones.
4. Check in the file.

## Open drawing from Vault

Open Drawing command is available from both Inventor model browser and Vault browser.

* If a single drawing is associated, drawing file is directly opened from Vault.
* If there are multiple drawing files associated, the ‘Select File’ dialog is shown listing the drawings associated to design file.

If you open historical revision design file in Inventor, set **Released Biased** flag **On** in the "Open Drawing" command to find the revision associated drawing file.

If you open historical revision design file in Inventor, set **Released Biased** flag **Off** in the "Open Drawing" command to find the latest revision associated drawing file.

### Add Files to a Vault

# Add Files to a Vault

Learn about adding files to a vault.

Design data can encompass many different types of files from CAD data to documents and spreadsheets. Autodesk Vault manages any data associated with your design project. In addition to tracking CAD data files, the version history of supporting files can also be tracked.

You can add any type of file to a vault. However, to add CAD data files to a vault, use the add-in specific to the CAD application. The CAD-specific add-ins track the relationships between the CAD files.

CAD data cannot be dragged and dropped into a vault.

Once a file is transferred to the vault, the file in the vault becomes the primary file. It is a recommended practice to delete the copy on your computer. When you want to view or edit the file, retrieve a copy from the vault by using the Get/Check Out command. This practice ensures that you are working with the latest version on your local computer.

The file stored in the vault is the primary copy of that file. Any files outside the vault are copies that have been borrowed from the vault for viewing or editing.

#### Adding Files to a Vault with the AutoCAD Vault Add-in

# Adding Files to a Vault with the AutoCAD Vault Add-in

Files are added to a vault using the Check In, Check In All or Check In Folder command. DXF files that are inside the working folder can also be checked in to a vault.

Use Check In for adding files to the vault for the first time and to check in a file that you have checked out. You can automatically create a visualization file attachments when files are checked in.

AutoCAD drawing files that are outside the working folder can be checked in from AutoCAD Mechanical. You are prompted that the file will be converted to an AutoCAD Mechanical drawing file. Click Yes to convert the file and continue with the check in process.

Note: You cannot have two or more files with the same name in the same folder.

Use the Check In Folder command to either add folders of existing legacy data to the vault in a single operation or to check in the contents of an entire folder all at once. For adding a large quantity of files, for example, adding a legacy project, you can check in a folder in non-interactive mode. This lets you start the check in process, and then turn your attention to something else as the files are added to the vault.

Use Check In All to add an AutoCAD Electrical project definition file along with its list of drawing files to the vault in a single operation while establishing their location inside the vault.

## Checking Files into the Vault for the First Time

Note: AutoCAD Electrical uses project files (.wdp) that list all of the drawing files included in the project.

Unless you are checking in a host or project file that references other files, you can only check in one file at a time using the Check In command. Host and project files contain the saved paths to all files it references to resolve links and cross-references between the documents in the design. When you add host or project files, all dependent files are added automatically to the vault.

The **Check In Folder** command lets you add an entire folder and its recursive contents to the vault in a single operation. Use this command to add legacy or existing files to the vault all at once. The recommended best practice when first using Autodesk Vault with an AutoCAD application is to add your existing data using the Check In Folder command.

The **Check In All** command lets you add an AutoCAD Electrical project definition file along with its list of drawing files to the vault in a single operation while establishing their location inside the vault. The project definition file may have one or many drawings that need to be added to the vault along with the project file for the first time. Once the project and drawings have been added to the vault, the drawing files are associated with this version of the project file. When you first check in a project definition file, the version number is 1.

Host and project files and their dependents must be added to vault in a way that the vault can resolve the relationship between the files. It is recommended that the referenced files exist at the same level as the host or project file or beneath it to ensure a simplified workflow.

The **Check In Settings** dialog box gives you options for structuring your files in the vault and for automatically attaching visualization files to files as they are checked into the vault.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| *Use organized folder structure* | places all files and folders under a single folder. The original folder structure is retained to the extent all referenced files exist at the same level or beneath the folder the host file resides in. Files that are not located on the same level or above the host file are placed under the host file automatically. |
| *Place all files in one folder* | flattens the entire folder structure and all files are placed at the same level as the top-level host or project file in the vault. The flatten command will not proceed when two or more file names are the same inside the same folder. |

These vault settings help ensure your data is organized in a way that is suitable for use with the vault. After you check a design into the vault using one of the options specified previously, anyone checking out those files brings the same folder structure down to their computer. When checking a design into the vault for the first time, the vault does the remapping. The saved paths for each xref are changed, and then saved back to each file before checking that file into the vault. When checking a project into the vault for the first time where drawing files are relocated, the vault modifies the mapping inside of the project definition file. This process ensures proper file resolution when the file and its xrefs are checked out of the vault, and subsequently checked back in.

When files located outside of the working folder are added to a vault for the first time, they are copied to the working folder, the xrefs are updated for the new path, and then the files are added to the vault. The files are then deleted from the original location outside of the working folder. You are prompted with a message that the original files will be deleted from their original location before checking the files in for the first time. Click Yes to continue with the check-in process.

Note: If one or more files cannot be checked in, then none of the files are deleted from the original location.

#### Adding Files to a Vault with the Inventor Vault Add-in

# Adding Files to a Vault with the Inventor Vault Add-in

Checking in files into the vault transfers files from your local working folder into the vault.

Note: You must be assigned the role of either Editor or Administrator to perform this action. Contact your Vault administrator to verify your role.

Before checking any files to the vault for the first time, make sure they conform to the rules for adding files to the vault.

1. The workspace and all library folders which are referenced in the Autodesk Inventor model must be mapped to corresponding vault folders before files can be added to the vault. Mapping the local folders referenced in the project to folders in the vault is necessary to maintain the project structure and the parent/child relationships.
2. A file that is outside either the workspace or the library search paths and is dependent on an Autodesk Inventor model cannot be added to the vault.

When attempting to check in an Autodesk Inventor file that breaks one or more of these rules, an error is displayed indicating which rule is being broken.

Autodesk .dwf files can be created and attached automatically when files are added to the vault. The .dwf attachments are only created for files that have changed or for files that do not have .dwf files published already. The paper clip icon is not displayed for automatically published .dwf files.

Important: If you are using express mode, Inventor requires that you load all of the parts required for .dwf publishing before checking in an assembly.

## Overview of the Check In Files for the First Time Process

* Files are added to the vault folders specified in the Map Folder dialog. The folder mappings are stored in the Autodesk Inventor project file so you do not have to select where files are to be stored in the vault during each time you add files.
* If exact copies of the files being added already exist elsewhere in the vault, you are warned that the files will be duplicated.
* Before files are added to the vault, they are checked for conformity with the folder structure of the vault to make sure the relationships resolve correctly.
* Files are copied from your local workspace and libraries into the vault. It is important to note that they are copied to the server and not removed from your local working folders.
* After files have been added to the vault, your local files are flagged as read-only. From this point on, the files must be checked out before editing.
* When adding Autodesk Inventor files using the Vault Check In for Autodesk Inventor, all parent/child relationships are maintained on the server. Having the vault store these relationships makes it easy for you to find where files are used and what the children of the files look like at any time.

# Check In Inventor Files for the First Time with the Inventor Vault Add-in

Any type of design data can be stored in a vault including documents, spreadsheets, model files, and so on.

Non-Autodesk Inventor files are added to the vault using Autodesk Vault. Autodesk Inventor files, however, must be added to the vault using the Vault add-in for Autodesk Inventor to maintain the relationships between the Autodesk Inventor model files. Files that are not vaulted are indicated by a question mark icon in the vault browser in Autodesk Inventor. Entire Autodesk Inventor projects can be added at once using Add Project.

Note: You must be assigned the role of either Editor or Administrator to perform this action. Contact your vault administrator to verify your role.

**Important:** Before adding Autodesk Inventor files to the vault:

* Open an Autodesk Inventor model.
* Log into the vault using the Vault add-in for Autodesk Inventor.
* Map the folders for the project to folders in the vault.

**Check In Autodesk Inventor Files to the vault:**

1. From the Autodesk Inventor browser bar, select Vault. The Vault browser is displayed.
2. Select the file that you want to check in. You can also select multiple files by pressing the Control or Shift keys.
3. Right-click the selection, and then select **Check In**. The Check In dialog box is displayed. Only the files that can be checked in to the vault are listed.
4. If necessary, select Keep files checked out to have the local files remain available for editing as soon as they are added to the vault
5. If you want to add parents or children of the selected files, click Settings. You can also specify whether or not .dwf files are automatically created and attached to the files.
6. Enter a comment describing the files being added to the vault.
7. Click OK.

Note: If an exact copy of the file already exists elsewhere in the vault, you are warned that the files will be duplicated. Click OK to proceed with adding the duplicate files or click Cancel to close the dialog box and not add the files to the vault. If you intend for the files to be used across multiple projects, either add the files to an existing library or add the path of the files to the library paths listed in the project file.

When the Autodesk Inventor files are added to the vault, all the relationships are recorded as well. The status of each file is indicated by the icon next to the file name in the vault browser.

##### Add an Entire Inventor Project to the Vault

# Add an Entire Inventor Project to the Vault

You can manually add an entire Autodesk Inventor project to a vault using Add Project. All drawings, parts, assemblies, and presentations for the active project are added to the vault at the same time, as well as any support files within the project structure such as documents and spreadsheets.

Note: Autodesk recommends that all Inventor projects be added to a vault using Autoloader. Refer to the Autoloader help for more information.

Autodesk Inventor project files that are not enabled for the vault cannot be added to the vault. The project file must be vault-enabled and the project folders must be mapped to vault folders before adding the project. Library files that have not been added to the vault are added as long as the library path in the project file is mapped to a vault folder. Library files are the only files located outside the project structure that are added to the vault using the Add Project command.

Each time the Add Project command is used for the active project, the new files contained within the local project structure that are not yet in the vault are added to the vault.

Autodesk .dwf files can be created and attached automatically when files are added to the vault. The .dwf attachments are only created for files that have changed or for files that do not have .dwf files published already. The paper clip icon is not displayed for automatically published .dwf files.

The Add Project command maintains the relationships between the files being added, including the following:

* Assembly files (.iam)
* Part files (.ipt)
* Drawing files (.idw,-.dwg)
* Presentation files (.ipn)

The following files are not added to the vault when adding a project:

* The Old Versions folder and all files contained within
* Other project (.ipj) files within active project
* Lock (.lck) files
* Files that have already been added to the vault.
* .bak files
* .tmp files

The Add Project dialog box adds all the related files in an Autodesk Inventor project to the vault at once while maintaining the project structure.

## Manually Add a Project to the Vault

1. In Inventor, click File > Vault Server > Check In Project. If the vault folders have been mapped to the project, a progress bar is displayed indicating that the local files are being scanned for relationships. After the files are scanned, the Add Project dialog box is displayed.
2. Verify that the project structure is complete in the file list.
3. Click Settings to specify whether or not .dwf files are automatically created and attached to the files.
4. Enter a comment for the files.
5. Click OK. A progress bar is displayed indicating that the files are being added to the vault.

Note: To automatically add the project (recommended), use Autodesk Autoloader: Start > Programs > Autodesk > Autodesk Data Management > Tools > Autodesk Autoloader. Learn more about Autodesk Autoloader by clicking on Help.

Note: Before manually adding an entire project to the vault, you must have mapped vault folders to the project.

### Check in Files and Folders into a Vault

# Check in Files and Folders into a Vault

When you are done working on a file that has been checked out of the vault, check the file back into the vault to store the changes with the version history.

Include a comment with the file describing the changes made to this version of the data when checking it in. The latest version of a file in the vault is the last version that was checked in. Once a file is checked in, the version in the vault is incremented and the latest changes are available for others to check out.

Only one person can have a file checked out at one time. If you want to make a file currently checked out to you available to others without recording your changes, you can either check the file in without saving the file or use Undo Checkout. If no changes were made to a file that is checked back into the vault, the version history is not incremented.

Note: Files must be saved before checking them in.

#### Check an AutoCAD Sheet Set into a Vault

# Check an AutoCAD Sheet Set into a Vault

Sheet set data are added to a vault using Check In command via Sheet Set Manager (ssm).

The process for checking in sheet set data is similar to checking in drawing files. However, once sheet sets are checked into a vault, there are some behaviors that differ from that of the drawing files.

These are the differences when a sheet set data is checked in:

* Once Sheet Set Data is vaulted, Vault uses data files to represent and manage Sheet Set Hierarchy:

  **Sheet Set Icons**

  | *Sheet Set Hierachy* | *Sheet Set Icon* | *Data File* | *Data File Icon* |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | Sheet Set |  | \*.DSS |  |
  | Sheet Sub Set |  | \*.DSU |  |
  | Sheet |  | \*.DSH |  |
* Data files will not interfere with the Sheet Set workflow. However, these files are automatically checked out when a user attempts to edit Sheet, Sheet Set, or Sub-sheet Set properties.
* Data files are automatically checked in after a sheet set command successfully completes.

Check Sheet Data into a Vault

1. Open the host file, project file, or the specific file you want to check back into the vault.

#### Check Files into a Vault with the Inventor Vault Add-in

# Check Files into a Vault with the Inventor Vault Add-in

Use Check In when you are ready to check files into the vault for the first time. In addition, use Check In when you are done working on an Autodesk Inventor file that has been checked out of the vault; check the file back into the vault to store the changes with the new version history.

Include a comment with the file describing the changes made to this version of the data when checking it in. The latest version of a file in the vault is the last version that was checked in. Once a file is checked in, the version in the vault is incremented and the latest changes are now available for others to check out.

Autodesk .dwf files can be created and attached automatically when files are checked into the vault. The .dwf attachments are only created for files that have changed or for files that do not have .dwf files published already.

Important: If you are using express mode, Inventor requires that you load all of the parts required for DWF publishing before checking in an assembly.

Note: If you are using Inventor Server to handle Vault jobs that generate DWF and/or PDF files, custom textures are not represented in the resulting DWF/PDF files. So, you can either use full Inventor or follow the steps below to use Inventor Server.

1. Stop and exit the Job Processor on the Job Processor machine.
2. Close all Inventor sessions on the same machine.
3. Copy all your custom textures from their location and paste them into the following path on the Job Processor machine - C:\Program Files\Common Files\Autodesk Shared\Inventor Interoperability 2025\Textures.
4. Restart the Job Processor.

Also, refer to this [article](https://help.autodesk.com/view/vault/2024/enu/?caas=caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/how-to-share-custom-inventor-textures-with-other-vault-users.html) when you work with custom texture.

Only one person can have a file checked out at one time. If you want to make a file currently checked out to you available to others without recording your changes, you can Undo Check Out. If no changes were made to a file that is checked back into the vault, the version history is not incremented.

## About the Select File from Vault Dialog for Check-in

Check in files to the vault for the first time, update the vault with changes made to a checked out file, and unlock the vault version so other users can check the file out to get a copy of your changes.

There are two commands you can use to release a checked out file after a file has been checked into the vault for the first time:

* The **Check In** command copies your changes into the database, creating a new version of the file. When other users use the Get Latest Version command or check out the file, they receive all the modifications you made.
* The **Undo Check Out** command voids all your changes and cancels the checked out state of the file.

When you check in a file, the vault provides a box where you can enter a comment.

Note: To update the version in the vault while keeping the file checked out, select the Keep Files Checked Out check box.

You can check in a file that has not changed at all. The vault executes the Undo Check Out command, and no new version is added to the file's history.

**Keep files checked out**

Checks the file back out to you immediately after checking it in.

**Close file and delete working copies**

Removes the working copy once the file is checked into the vault.

**Scan Configurations**

The related files scanning behavior can be set up on the Scan Configuration dialog. Click the drop-down box beside the Include Related Files button and then click Scan Configuration to access the dialog.

The Scan Configuration dialog allows you to choose the different options to limit the scan areas within your local disk.

* **File Types** – The different file formats to be included during the scan operation. A green tick on the file icon represents that it is included for scanning.
* **File Name** – this option limits scanning to file names that are the same as the Inventor models.
* **Locations** – Choose the scanning location that exists in the same path(s) as the Inventor Models, or specify a custom location.

**Settings**

### Getting and Checking Out Files in Vault

# Getting and Checking Out Files in Vault

There is an important difference between getting a file, checking out a specific version or revision of a file, and performing a quick checkout. Vault uses two different commands to perform these tasks: Get and Checkout.

## The Get Command

Use the [Get](GUID-91636F7C-2FA9-4141-9462-66227AD966FB.htm) command to download a read-only copy of a file from the vault and to check out specific versions or revisions of files for editing.

![](../images/menu-ve-get.png)

* **Get a read-only copy of a file** – By default, the Get command retrieves a **read-only** version of the file from the vault and places it in the working folder. This file can be viewed but cannot be modified because it is not checked out. This means that another user could check out the file and make changes. You will not see the changes until the user checks the file back into the vault and you perform a refresh.

  You have the option of selecting a specific version or revision of a file to download, otherwise the Get operation defaults to the latest version of the file in vault-basic and the latest version of the leading revision in Vault Professional.

  The file can also be checked out by selecting the check box in the Get dialog.
* **Check out a specific version or revision of a file** – By default, the latest version of the file is displayed. You can select a specific version of the file in vault-basic or a specific revision of the file in Vault Professional from the history drop-down menu. If the check box is selected next to the file in the Get dialog, it is marked for Check Out. When you click OK, a **read-write** version (vault-basic) or revision (Vault Professional) of the file is retrieved from the vault and placed in the working folder. This file can be modified and no other user can make changes to the file while it is checked out to you.

## The Checkout Command

Perform a quick checkout on a file with the [Checkout](GUID-AB119C15-D9AB-4358-BCC2-672D39FB411A.htm) command.

* ![](../images/menu-ve-checkout-2015r2.png)

  **Quick Check Out:** Use the Checkout command as a fast way to bypass the Get dialog and always check out the latest version of the file in vault-basic or the latest revision of the file in Vault Professional. The file is checked out but is not automatically downloaded to the working folder. This is known as a quick checkout.

  Note: See [Understand Revisions](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-1FAD3749-175C-485F-A09E-41EA5D41E5CA) for more information.

#### Rules for Checking Files Out of a Vault

# Rules for Checking Files Out of a Vault

Checking out a file changes the read-only attribute of the local copy to read/write. Once a file is checked out, it can be edited.

Rules for Checking Out Files

* Only one member of a team can check out a file at one time.
* No one else can modify a checked out file until it has been checked back into the vault.
* You can check out one file, multiple files, or all files in a folder.

Tip: Refer to the User Name column to determine who has a certain file checked out.

# Perform a Quick Checkout on a File with the Vault Client

Use the Checkout command to perform a quick checkout on a file in the Vault client.

## Rules for Quick Checkout

* A quick checkout always checks out the latest version of the file. If you want to get a specific version or revision of a file, see the [Get command](GUID-F64CF492-8F37-4A35-AE00-25835D82AD50.htm).
* The file is checked out but is not automatically downloaded to the working folder.
* If there is a local version of the file in the working folder and it is not the latest version, then the file is not checked out.

## Perform a Quick Checkout

1. Right-click on the file that you want to check out and select Checkout.

   ![](../images/menu-ve-checkout-2015r2.png)

   The file is checked out to you.

#### The Get Dialog in the Vault Client

# The Get Dialog in the Vault Client

Learn about the Get dialog in the Vault Client.

The Get dialog has two view settings: collapsed (<<) and expanded (>>). The collapsed view provides an express workflow for checking files and folders out of a vault. The expanded view provides more information about the files available for checkout. Additional settings are also available in this view, such as working folder preferences or released bias enforcement.

Tip: By default, the Get dialog is collapsed. If you want the dialog to stay expanded every time you open it, click the Pin button ![](../images/icon-pinnotinplace.png).

### Refresh File from Vault (add-ins-only)

# Refresh File from Vault (add-ins-only)

The Refresh From Vault command compares the local file version with the version in the vault.

If the local version is not the latest, the Refresh from Vault gets the latest version of the file to the [local working folder](GUID-E9B067D1-227C-4DEA-934E-7AF090C4EAC6.htm), and the current file is reloaded.

Which version the command retrieves depends upon the [edition](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-AC53CA07-BD55-4C7E-9483-288FFAAFCC9A) of Autodesk Vault.

* For Vault Basic, this command retrieves the latest version currently stored in the vault.
* For Vault Professional, this command retrieves the correct version of the leading revision currently stored in the vault. This is not necessarily the latest version.

### Manage Visualization Files

# Manage Visualization Files

Learn about visualization files in Vault. You can attach visualization files to other files or remove existing attachments.

## Learn about Visualization Files

By default, visualization files are created and attached to data files automatically when files are checked into the vault. Visualization files are only created for files that have changed or for files that do not have visualization files published already. The automatically generated files that are stored in the vault can also be stored on the local computer. You can specify a default folder location for the published visualization files. Automatic publishing can be turned off to save room and keep the size of the vault down.

Automatically generated visualization files are hidden in the file list by default. Use Show Hidden Files on the Options dialog to display the hidden attachments. The paper clip icon is not displayed for automatically published visualization files.

## Attach Files to Other Files in a Vault

You can add attachments between any two or more files within the vault. Attaching a file to another in Autodesk Vault creates an association between the two files in the vault. Using attachments, you can check out all the files that are linked together and work on them as a unit, regardless of the applications that created the files. For example, you may want to attach a set of images to a Microsoft Word document if the images are linked to that file. In a design environment, you may want to assign a relationship from a document that represents assembly instructions to the actual CAD assembly files.

Attachments are indicated by a paper clip in the main pane. The paper clip icon is not displayed for automatically published .dwf files.

Note: Attaching and detaching files from another file in the vault creates a new version of the file.

### Attach one or more files in the vault to another file in the vault

Note: Attaching and detaching files in the vault creates a new version of the associated file. Attachments are indicated by a paper clip in the main pane. The paper clip icon is not displayed for automatically published .dwf files.

### Create Folders in a Vault

# Create Folders in a Vault

Use folders to organize your files in the vault in the same way you organize folders on your computer.

The folder structure inside the vault should be identical to the folder structure of the project on the local computer. The root directory in a vault is represented as $/.

![](../images/pane-allfolders.png)

**Vault file folders**

When creating file folders, click the existing folder that you want to create a new folder under, and then right-click and select New Folder on the context-menu.

If you are creating the first folder in the vault, click the Vault Explorer root (defined by $). Folders can be renamed or moved if required.

**Library folders**

Library files are typically static in nature, reused often in many different designs, and are standards within an organization. A file becomes a library file by checking a file into a Library folder in the vault. Library folders can only be created directly off the root level of the vault.

Note: A folder can be defined as a library folder to contain read-only library parts.

## Markup

# Markup

Markup consists of annotations that you can superimpose on a design or drawing in the viewer. The viewer supports markup in the Vault Client and the Thin Client.

Use markup to add comments, information, and suggestions for design changes to the drawing file.

To access markup tools in the viewer:

1. [View a file](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-B5B204B1-5219-4EA2-AC58-5E20F375E345).

   Note: To view a file in the Thin Client, view the topic [Thin Client - The Viewer](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-E7707879-4505-434A-AEAA-761794F720F2).
2. Select Markup ![](../images/icon-markup.png) in the viewer toolbar.

   The markup icon indicates the number of markups associated with the file. If the file contains existing markup, the markups are listed in the Markup Browsing Panel. Select the markup to view in canvas.
3. Click **Create new** to clear the canvas and create a new markup.
4. Use markup tools to add text or annotations.

   Note: Use the Undo and Redo buttons as needed to remove and re-insert annotations.
5. Click **Save** to save the markup as data on the Vault or save a local copy as an image. See [Save Markups](markup.html#save-markups) for details.

When the markup tool is selected, you can click on the arrow icons in the action bar or toolbar to show (>) or hide (<) panels and gain more screen space.

## Markup Browsing Panel

The Markup Browsing Panel displays all the markups saved as data for that file, along with details such as who created the markup and the creation date. In the Markup Browser Panel you can:

* search markups based on the markup title or the creator.
* view, rename, or delete the saved markup.
* show (>) or hide (<) the Markup Browsing Panel.

## Edit Markup

Select the markup from the Markup Browsing Panel to edit the markup.

Note: All existing markups for the historic CAD file version can be viewed in the Viewer, however, only the latest CAD file version can be modified for the markup content. You cannot add, delete, or modify markup for historical file versions.

## Save Markups

Markup isn't recorded in the viewer. To keep a reference copy of your markup, you can save the markup as an image on your local machine or save it as data on the Vault. All unsaved markups are discarded after confirmation.

Note: Markup saved as data is supported only for design files and not for pdf or other file formats. In Thin Client, you can only save a snapshot of the markup, downloaded as a .png file.

## Markup in eco

You can view markup within eco using Autodesk Viewer, make changes to the markup, and save it as data in the Vault. You can add comments to each save performed on the markup. See [View Markup Files Attached to a Change Order](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-A18529C8-3F81-40F4-AD34-00D7B8D8DF7D) for more information.

## Has Markup Properties

The markup system properties help you identify files or versions with associated markup. You can use these properties to search and customize views with a "true" value.

* **Has Markup**: True/False (indicates-if-any-file-version-(including historic versions) of the file has associated markups or not)
* **Has Markup Historical**: True/False (indicates-if-the-selected-version-of-the-file-has-associated-markups-or-not)

## Searching Vault

# Searching Vault

Search provides a quick and convenient way to locate files and folders. Use tokens and wild cards to search a vault.

**Basic Search** - Basic Search uses your search word to look for any property that contains the search keyword. The results are displayed in the grid.

**Search By Property** - Property Search lets you refine your search criteria based on file properties. Use this feature if you know exactly with which property to search.

**Wildcard Support** - Wildcards ? and \* are supported in the search. Use ? to replace a single character and \* to replace multiple characters in your search keyword. The search always looks for files/folders containing the search words, so the result set might be the same if the search word is short and contains a common word. For example, the following search conditions return the same set of result: 'app\*', 'app?', 'app' all return results containing apple, application, etc.

**Saved Search** - You can save the search for future use. Once these searches are saved, they are listed under Saved Searches. You may use the Search folder to edit, delete, and rename the saved searches.

**Criteria-Based Search** - You can use the existing saved search to apply the criteria to the basic search (grid).

### Searching with Tokens

# Searching with Tokens

The search system indexes tokens instead of whole property values.

Tokens are individual chunks of a property value that allow the system to locate files based on pieces of information. This type of searching allows for quicker search results and reduces the impact to the system when searching vaults containing thousands of property values.

Knowing how property values are broken down into tokens allows you to search for tokens only. This reduces the impact to the system when returning multiple results by letting you refine your search. Now when you perform the same search for DES, only the files with the author's name of DES are returned. The results do not include the Design00.idw file because the first token is Design, whereas the author's initials of DES are a complete token.

## How Property Values are Broken into Tokens

All adjacent characters of like type are grouped into a single token. Like type is alphabetic (a,-b,-c,-...z), numeric (0,1,2,..9), or special punctuation (-,-,@...$). Numbers with dots are not recognized as separate tokens.

Only six punctuation characters are searchable:

* Dollar sign ($)
* Dash (-)
* Underscore (-)
* At sign (@)
* Plus sign (+)
* Pound sign (#)

All other punctuation are not searchable and are not contained in tokens.

This table shows how a few different file names would be broken down into tokens.

| File Name | Tokens |
| --- | --- |
| A-055401-321.ipt | A - 055401 - 321 ipt |
| Great White Shark.doc | Great White Shark doc |
| Gr8work.xls | Gr 8 work xls |

This ability to specify search values based on tokens allows more latitude when constructing searches. The search tries to find equivalence to string in the search field. It will not display results if you use tokens individually. You can append a wildcard for broader searches or specify a token for more refined returns.

### Using '@me' for Personalized Searches

Vault now supports '@me' keyword in the 'Value' field for more personalized searches. It automatically replaces '@me' with the current user's display name across both basic and advanced searches.

You can use '@me' with all string properties and operators (is, is not, contains, does not contain) and across all clients including thick, thin, mobile, and add-ins.

### Searching with Wildcards

# Searching with Wildcards

You can use wildcards and boolean operators when specifying search criteria.

Boolean operators are only available in the Advanced tab of the Find dialog and work only within a single search criterion. You cannot use a boolean operator between search criteria.

Note: Leading wildcards are supported.

**Wildcards**

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| \* | Represents any number of characters within a string. |
| ? | Represents a single character within a string. |

**Boolean Operators (case-insensitive)**

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| and | Searches for x AND y in any order. The search granny AND smith returns anything containing both words. |
| or | Searches for either x OR y. The search granny OR smith returns anything containing either word. |
| not | Searches for documents that do NOT contain x. The search NOT granny returns anything which does not contain granny. |
| " " | Searches for the phrase contained within the quotation marks.  Note:  Tokenized search rules are still applied to the string within the quotation marks but special operators (and,-or,-not) within the quotation marks are treated as text. |

### Perform a Search

# Perform a Search

The basic search searches a specified set of properties for a text string. Use the basic search field to locate any file item, change order, or folder based on simple search criteria.

When a search is performed, the main view displays the results of the search. Clear the search field to display the main view in its entirety. The Search field can be expanded to add criteria to the search using the query builder. Use [manage saved searches](GUID-6B47BD0B-67EB-42B5-B6EC-199D9C4143EF.htm) to select/deselect the saved searches you have created that you want to set on the Vault Client.

Note: Only the file properties that are set to Searched in the File Property Management dialog are searched when using the basic search. The settings in the File Property Management dialog apply only to the basic search and not to the query builder. See Manage File Properties for more information on managing file properties.

You can also save a search, create a search folder, or access the Find dialog from the basic Search field.

## Perform a Quick Search

1. The Search field is located in the title bar of the main view.
2. In the Search field, enter a text string for which to search and then click ![](../images/search-button.png).

   The search results are displayed in the main view.
3. Click X to clear or cancel search to display the entire contents of the main view again.
4. Click the drop-down arrow in the search field and select Save Search to save the current search criteria. By default, it is saved as a search folder.

   If you are an administrator, you have the option to save the search as a [distributed search](GUID-6B47BD0B-67EB-42B5-B6EC-199D9C4143EF.htm).

   The newly created search folder is listed in the navigation pane under the "Saved Search Folders" node.

If you want to perform a similar search in the future, you can save the search and apply the saved search criteria to the basic search (grid). You can review the criteria to ensure they are still relevant and adjust them if needed.

### Add Search Criteria Using the Query Builder

With the query builder, you can create more detailed queries by adding properties and values to the search criteria.

1. Expand the query builder.
2. To search across all available properties, enter a value in the Multiple Properties field. This is the same as using the basic Search field without using the query builder.
3. When searching for files, the query builder contains Multiple Properties, File Name, and Comment by default. When searching for items, the query builder contains Multiple Properties, Number, Title, and Description by default. The default properties can be changed and more properties added to the query.

   * To add a property in the query builder, click Add Criteria and then select a property to add to the search criteria.
   * To change a property already listed in the query builder to a different property, click the property name in the query builder and then select a new property. The selected property replaces the existing property in the query builder.
   * To remove a property from the search criteria, click the property name in the query builder and then select Remove.

   Note: The properties selected in the query builder are retained from session to session.
4. Enter a value for any or all of the properties listed in the query builder.

   Note: The search condition when using the basic search and the query builder is "contains". To perform searches using conditions other than "contains", use the Find dialog.
5. Click Search. The results matching all the combined search criteria are displayed in the main view. Additional refined searches can be performed on the results until the results are cleared.
6. Click Clear to remove the property values from the query builder. When a search is cleared, the main view no longer displays the search results.

### Using Criteria-Based Basic Search

You can use the Saved Search to apply the criteria to the basic search (grid).

To perform a search based on the saved criteria:

1. Click the drop-down arrow in the search field.
2. Select "Apply Criteria of", and then select the saved search you want to apply the criteria of to the basic search.
3. Review the criteria to ensure they are still relevant and adjust them if needed.
4. Add an input string to filter based on the saved criteria.

If the criteria applied to the basic search (grid) do not match the workspaces parameter or the folder parameter, the search is performed within the current folder you are in. Additionally, if the option is selected, it will also search within subfolders.

De-select the saved search under the "Apply Criteria of" option if you do not wish to use the criteria.

Note:

* The applied criteria are cleared when expanding the grid search.
* The text field becomes read-only when you load a recent search with criteria.
* The "Apply criteria of" list does not show a saved search when you,

  + input a string in the grid text box and save the search.
  + input a string in the multiple properties grid text box and save the search.
  + input a string in the multiple properties grid text box and add some property criteria to search and save the search.
  + perform advanced search with empty value or empty property.

### Using a Parameterized Search

Using the Advanced tab in the Find dialog, you can create and save a parameterized search folder. A parameterized search folder is a saved search for which you are prompted for values when the search is initiated.

1. From the navigation pane, select a parameterized search folder from Saved Search Folders. The basic search is expanded to show the query builder displaying the search criteria for the parameterized search.
2. Enter values for the search criteria.
3. Click Search.

### Basic Search Options

Depending on whether you are searching for files or items, different options are available for the basic search.

* Click the drop-down menu next to the Search field.

  Or
* In the query builder, click Options.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| *Recent Searches* | The 10 most recent search strings are saved for quick access. Select *Recent Searches* and then select a search string from the list. |
| *Search Subfolders* | You can specify whether or not subfolders are also searched. Select *Search Subfolders* from the Options menu to exclude or include subfolders when searching. Subfolders are searched by default. This option is only available when searching for files. |
| *Search File Content* | By default, only file properties are searched for the specified text string. To expand the scope of the search to include file content, select *Search File Content* from the Options menu. This option is only available when searching for files. |
| *Save Search...* | Select *Save Search* to save the current search criteria. By default, it is saved as a search folder. If you are an administrator, you have the option to save the search as a [distributed search](GUID-6B47BD0B-67EB-42B5-B6EC-199D9C4143EF.htm). |
| *Apply Criteria of* | You can select the saved search you want to apply the criteria of to the basic search. |
| *Find...* | Select *Find* to display the Find dialog and perform a more complex search. |

## Perform an Advanced Search

* The Property list contains the properties associated with the files stored in the current vault and the items in the item master as well as the properties associated with change orders.. From the Property list, select a property for which to search.

  + If Any is selected from the Look For list, all properties are listed.
  + If Change Orders is selected from the Look For list, only change order properties are listed.
  + If Files is selected from the Look For list, only file properties are listed.
  + If Items is selected from the Look For list, only item properties are listed.
* Select a conditional statement from the Condition list.
* Enter a value for the selected property that corresponds to the condition set for the search.
* Click Add to include the search in the list of search criteria. If more than one search is added to the criteria list, the search combines the criteria and performs an AND search.
* You can replace one search criteria with another. Specify the property, condition, and value for the new criteria. Select the existing criteria to replace and then click Replace.
* To eliminate search criteria from the advanced search, select the criteria from the list and then click Remove.

### Saving a Search

# Saving a Search

You can save the search criteria entered in the Quick Find bar or in the Find dialog box so that you can perform the same search again.

The criteria are saved but the results of the search are not. Searches are saved per user account, so your saved searches are accessible only to you. A saved search can only be opened in the Find dialog.

A search folder is similar to a saved search. Each search folder is associated with a saved search. Search folders are listed in the navigation pane under My Searches. When a search folder is selected, the saved search associated with it is automatically performed and the results are displayed in the main view.

**Distributed Search**

In addition to the saved searches created by you, listed under My Searches in the navigation pane, there are distributed searches that are saved by the administrator tailored to your project. This is the initial search criteria set when you access the system.

As an administrator, you can create a search criterion and save it as a distributed search for use. The administrator can then deploy the configured settings to the Vault Client, allowing users to use it for their regular activities.

Note: You need Vault Set Options permission to manage and deploy client configuration settings.

As a user, you can use the default search criteria created by the administrator, or copy to modify it as per your requirement.

**Save Search**

Search folders can be created from existing saved searches or directly from the Find dialog.

To save a search:

* In the **Find** dialog, click ![](../images/icon-savesearch.png) Save Current Search to save the current search criteria.
* Enter the name of the search in the **Save Search** dialog.
* Select **Save As Folder** to save the search as a folder. Search folders are listed in the navigation pane under My Searches. By default, it is saved as a search folder.

  If you are an administrator, you can select **Save As Distributed Search** to save the search as a distributed search to be used by the users.

When the results of a search folder are displayed in the main view, the Quick Find bar can be used to perform a search within the search results to further narrow the field. The combined search can then be saved, resulting in a saved search that consists of the search folder criteria AND the Quick Find criteria.

If you want to perform a similar search in the future, you can apply the saved search criteria to the basic search (grid). You can review the criteria to ensure they are still relevant and adjust them if needed. See [Criteria-Based Basic Search](GUID-0C7AA7BF-9158-4F8D-B312-CE0B2ED174A2.htm).

## Manage Saved Searches

The Manage Saved Searches dialog lists all the saved searches created by you and the distributed searches created by the administrator. You can only copy, rename, or delete the saved search you have created. You can't rename or delete the distributed searches that are created by the administrator.

* **Display As Folder**: Lists all the saved searches created by you. Select/deselect the saved searches you want to set on the Vault Client.
* **Distributed**: Lists all the distributed searches created by the administrator. Select/deselect the distributed searches you want to deploy on the Vault Client. Available for administration only.
* **Rename**: Rename the selected saved search. Enter the new search name.
* **Copy**: Copy the selected saved search. Enter the search name and select **Save As Folder** to display the copied search under My Searches.

  For administrator: Select **Save As Distributed Search** to save the search on the server to be deployed on the Vault Client of all users.
* **Delete**: Delete the selected saved search.

Note: Due to unique file name enforcement, you can't use the same name for both local and distributed searches.

If you, as an administrator, create a distributed search using the same naming convention as a local search being used by an end-user, Vault will replace the local search with the distributed search without notifying the user.

## Group Saved Searches

**Create a New Saved Search Group**

1. Right-click the My Searches node or Distributed Searches node (available-for-administration) under the Saved Search Folders, and click **New Group**.
2. Enter a new name for the group in the text box.
3. Select a saved search, and then drag it to the new group. The saved search is moved into the group.
4. Double-click the group to expand it.
5. Drag saved search within the group to change their order within the list.

**Rename a Saved Search Group**

Right-click a group, and then select **Rename** from the context menu. Enter a new name for the group in the text box.

**Remove a Saved Search Group**

Right-click a group, and then select **Delete** from the context menu. The Saved Search Group is removed and any Saved Search contained in the group is removed also.

## Open a Saved Search

To open a saved search:

* Right-click on the saved search and click **Open Saved Search**.
* Alternatively, in the **Find** dialog, click ![](../images/icon-opensearch.png) to open the saved search dialog.

  The Open Saved Search dialog lists all the saved searches created by you as well as the distributed searches created by the administrator.
* Select the saved search to open.
* Click **Open**.

## Autodesk Vault Icon Reference

# Autodesk Vault Icon Reference

Icons and the font color used for the file name indicate the status of files in the vault.

The icons indicate whether you have a local copy, if your copy is up-to-date, if you have a current version, and so on. The font color will indicate if the file is not checked out, is checked out to you, or is checked out to another user. The following table contains a legend for the icons.

The icon color slightly differs based on the user interface theme (light/dark/default). You can select the theme under [Vault Options](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-7EC936C7-12F5-43C9-A038-83DDD8F74C8A).

Some status icons differ based on the Vault edition and the release year.

## Vault Basic

Refer to these tables for status icons in Autodesk Vault Basic.

**Autodesk Vault Basic Status Icons**

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *Icons (default-classic-theme)* | *Icons (Light/Dark theme)* | *Description and Required Action* |
| No icon | No icon | Local file not available.  Use Get Latest Version to retrieve a copy of the file.  If no icon is displayed, the file is in the vault, but you do not have a local copy of the file on your computer. |
|  |  | File available for checkout.  This is the latest version of the file.  It means that the file is in the vault and available to be checked out. The version in your working folder is the same as in the vault, also referred to as the Latest Version. |
|  |  | File modified.  The file is available for check out but the local version of the file is newer than the latest version in the vault.  It means that your local file was changed without checking it out. If you want to save these changes, check the file out with the Don't Get Local Copy option. |
|  |  | File is outdated.  Use Check Out to get the latest version from the vault.  It means that the file is in the vault and available to be checked out, but the local copy is out of date. Get the latest version from the vault. |
|  |  | Local file not available and file is checked out.  Use Get Latest Version to retrieve a copy of the file.  This can occur if you have not set a working folder, if you previously checked out the file without getting a local copy, or you checked out the file to a location other than your working folder. |
|  |  | File checked out.  The local copy of the file is the latest version in the vault. |
|  |  | File modified and checked out.  The local version of the file is newer than the latest version in the vault.  It means that you made changes to the file since it was checked out but have not checked it back in. |
|  |  | File checked out but outdated.  File checked out but the local version of the file is older than the latest version in the vault.  It means that you started with a version for the vault that was older than the latest version, and then checked it out to promote it to the latest. |
|  |  | Local file unavailable and checked out to others.  File checked out by another user but no local copy available. Use Get Latest Version to retrieve a copy of the file. |
|  |  | File checked out to others.  The local copy of the file is the latest version in the vault.  This typically happens if the other user did not check changes back into the vault. |
|  |  | File modified and checked out to others.  The local version of the file is newer than the latest version in the vault.  This typically happens when the local file has been edited without checking it out and someone else has the file checked out. |
|  |  | File outdated and checked out to others.  File checked out by another user and the local version of the file is older than the latest version in the vault.  This typically happens if the other user checked changes into the vault, but kept the file checked out. |
|  |  | File with attachments.  The file has attachments. Expand the tree to see what files are attached. |
|  |  | File is not saved in the vault.  Use Check In to add the file to the vault. |
|  |  | Library folder.  Refers to the folder in the vault that is a library. A library folder is a special designation meaning the files within this folder are not intended to be edited when used in context of another assembly. Files within a library folder have two distinct characteristics.   * They are not allowed to be shared into any other folder. * They are typically stored and referenced on a shared common, networked location. |

## Vault Professional

Refer to these tables for status icons in Vault Professional.

**Autodesk Vault Professional Fonts**

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| *Font* | *Description* |
| *Black/Normal* | The file is not checked out. |
| *Blue/Bold* | The file is checked out to you.  Note: Files which are checked out to you and have changes in memory that have not been saved will have an asterisk appended to the file name (e.g.,-fork-damper.dwg\*\*). |
| *Gray/Italic/Strikethrough* | The file is checked out to another user. |
| *Vault Status Modifier (+)* | Local copy has saved edits. |

**Autodesk Vault Professional Status Icons**

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *Icons (default-classic-theme)* | *Icons (Light/Dark theme)* | *Description and Required Action* |
| No icon | No icon | Local file not available.  Use Get Latest Version to retrieve a copy of the file.  If no icon is displayed, the file is in the vault, but you do not have a local copy of the file on your computer. |
|  |  | File available for check out.  The file is available for check out or maybe checked out to another user.  This is the latest version of the file, and you have a local copy of the file on your workspace. |
|  |  | File checked out.  The local copy of the file is the latest version in the vault.  Use Check In to check the file back into the vault or select Undo Checkout to cancel any changes and check the file back into the vault. |
|  |  | File modified and checked out.  The local copy of the file is newer than the latest version in the vault.  This typically means that you made changes to the file since it was checked out but have not checked it back in. |
|  |  | File modified.  The local version of the file is newer than the latest version in the vault.  This typically means that your local file was changed without checking it out.  Note: This icon may also appear if a user is sharing a working folder with another user who has checked out the file, made changes, but has not yet checked the file back in. Vault will see that the file has been updated locally, but that the changes are different from those currently saved to the vault. In this instance, the file is not available for check out since the other user already has it checked out. |
|  |  | File is released but not the latest version.  The local copy of the file is not the latest version of the latest revision.  This typically happens when you have a local copy of the released version but a quick change has been executed by another user. |
|  |  | File is not saved in the vault.  Use Check In to add the file to the vault. |
|  |  | Historical revision.  The local version is a historical revision of a file in the vault. |
|  |  | File is outdated.  Use Refresh from Vault to get the latest version of the file. |
|  |  | File locked for editing.  The local copy of the file is the latest version in the vault. |
|  |  | File locked and local copy unavailable.  File locked for editing and the local copy of the file is not available. |

### Configure Vault Options

# Configure Vault Options

There are several ways to streamline your vault workflow in the Vault client and the Vault add-ins.

You can specify the default response for common dialogs so that every time certain dialogs are displayed, your preferred response is the default selection. You can also specify which commands are automatically performed without prompting you for input, reducing the number of times you need to directly interact with the vault.

Application settings and dialog suppression options vary, depending on the add-in. Refer to the section for your particular add-in for more information about the settings available.

The Vault client and the add-in clients each have an options page to help you customize your Vault experience. Refer to the client or add-in section for more information.

### Support for AutoCAD Verticals and Profiles

Distributed options for AutoCAD add-ins are now managed separately by AutoCAD profiles. This allows Vault to maintain distinct settings for each AutoCAD vertical (for example, ACAD, ACM, ACADE).

* Stored by profile: Distributed options use the AutoCAD profile name in the persistence key, similar to how local settings are saved in `ApplicationPreferences.xml` where the profile name is appended to the category name. This ensures that options set in one profile (for example, ACM) will not affect settings in another profile (such as ACAD).
* Enhanced filtering: While all distributed options are stored together in the database, the Vault client shows and applies only the options relevant to the current AutoCAD vertical. For instance, the "Ignore AutoCAD view-only changes" option appears in ACAD and ACADM but not in ACADE, which doesn't support this feature.

### Using Data Standard

# Using Data Standard

Data Standard is a data control feature for the Vault Client, Vault Office Client, Inventor, and AutoCAD that helps you enter data for new or existing files in a standardized format.

Vault has many ways in which you can enter or modify data surrounding a file, but some companies require a standardized format for their files. With Data Standard, administrators can design a save dialog that enforces the company's requirements for file data.

Note: See [Data Standard Administration](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-5030830E-69F8-4A57-ABE4-D1D430C58F95) for more information on customizing the Data Standard dialog.

## How It Works

The basic features of Data Standard are the same across all supported applications. Start your application, create a new document, and start writing or designing your content. After you first save a file, the Data Standard dialog appears requesting certain data. Once you complete all of the fields, Data Standard generates the file name and location based on the data. The Save button becomes active only when all required fields are complete.

Once the document has been saved, the entered data is mapped to the file's properties. You do not have to worry about project folders, revising the file, or generating a file name. Data Standard does everything.

#### Data Standard Interface for Vault Client and Vault Office Client

# Data Standard Interface for Vault Client and Vault Office Client

Manage file data and create new files in the Vault client or Vault Office client with the Data Standard feature.

Note: The Data Standard feature must be installed to use data sheets.

## The Data Standard Interface

Two new tabs display in the Vault client and Vault Office client by default when Data Standard is installed (CAD-BOM and Datasheet).

These tabs may change, or more may be added, based on how your administrator has designed the experience.

### CAD-BOM Preview

The CAD-BOM preview pane displays the BOM details for the selected file, including any data gathered from outside applications.

![](../images/cad-bom-preview.png)

### Datasheet Preview

The Datasheet preview displays standard file properties determined by your administrator. For example, the default datasheet provides at-a-glance view of pertinent file information, such as lifecycle state and category.

![](../images/datasheet-preview.png)

**Parent page:** [Using Data Standard](GUID-D475D22B-3873-4B78-9936-DD773F109136.htm)


#### Set Up a Data Standard File Template

# Set Up a Data Standard File Template

New files cannot be created with Data Standard until a templates folder is created in Vault and at least one file template has been added to the folder. This file template is used to create new Vault files.

1. Create a folder at the root ($) level of your vault called Templates.

   Note: Administrators can specify a different folder for the templates by modifying the XAML file. See [Customize Template Folder Path for Data Standard](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-DBDC927B-269D-4552-AECF-37CEDE0AE326) for more information.
2. Add one or more templates from which to create files to the templates folder.

   ![](../images/templates-folder.png)

   After the template has been added, you can use Data Standard to [add new files](Create-a-New-Vault-File-with.htm) to the vault based on the template.

**Parent page:** [Using Data Standard](GUID-D475D22B-3873-4B78-9936-DD773F109136.htm)

#### Using Data Standard with the Vault Add-ins

# Using Data Standard with the Vault Add-ins

The Vault Data Standard dialog is available in Inventor and AutoCAD. Whenever you first save a file, the Data Standard dialog displays. Fill in the required fields and any additional fields set up by your [administrator](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-5030830E-69F8-4A57-ABE4-D1D430C58F95) and click OK to save your data. The data is saved as a Data Sheet that can be modified in the future.

Note: The Data Standard feature must be installed to use data sheets.

Note: The Data Standard feature must be enabled before you can use it.

## Default Data Standard Dialogs

Data Standard for Vault installs default Data Standard dialogs that can be modified by an administrator.

The default dialog differs based on your release of Vault.

Users can enter a new title, description, and company information for the file. All other fields are automatically determined by the XAML.

By default, the following fields are provided.

![](../images/newfile-inventor-2025-2.png)

Users can select a numbering scheme and, if applicable, add prefixes or suffixes. They can also choose a folder for the file and provide a title, description, and comments. If the desired folder is not available, users can create a new one.

Note: If no numbering schemes are available for selection, the File Name field can be edited.

All other fields are automatically determined by the XAML.

The file name is generated when the user clicks OK.

If the administrator has enabled the Check-in dialog for Vault, you may be prompted to fill your check-in details as well.

## Copying Files

Use the Copy command to copy an assembly or part that needs to be modified.

**Inventor Only–**Use the Copy incl. Drawing command to copy an open part or assembly as well as the drawing that references it. The copied drawing will reference the copied part or assembly.

Note: Only an open Inventor assembly or part can be selected.

For each new copy, the Data Standard dialog appears when the file is saved for the first time.

## Save Copy As (inventor-only)

Use Save Copy As to copy parts, assemblies, drawings, or presentations in other formats, such as DWG, STP, PDF, or DXF.

1. With the part, assembly, drawing, or presentation open, click Save Copy As.

   ![](../images/menu-inventordatastandardribbon-savecopyas.png)
2. On the Save copy as dialog, select the category, the format to which you want to copy the open file, and a numbering scheme, if applicable. Enter comments, if desired.

   ![](../images/dialog-inventordatastandard-savecopyas-dialog-2025-2.png)
3. Click the Options Button to customize the print range, display settings, or vector resolution for the file. Click OK.

   ![](../images/dialog-inventordatastandard-savecopyas-optionsdialog.png)
4. Click OK on the Save copy as dialog to save the file as the new format.

   The file is automatically saved in the workspace and the vault. There is no need to perform a Vault check-in.

## Replace with Copy (Inventor Only)

Use the Replace with Copy command to copy a component of an assembly and replace it in the original file. This is useful when you want to reuse an Inventor assembly and replace the components that need to be modified with a copy.

Use the Replace with Copy incl. Drawing command to copy the component and the drawing that references it and replaces both in the original file. The copied drawing will reference the copied component.

Note: Only first level components of an Inventor assembly can be selected.

![](../images/ds-ribbon-rwc-expand.png)

For each new copy, the Data Standard dialog appears when the file is saved for the first time.

Note: Data Standard prompts for Copy and Replace with Copy can be configured. See [Manage Prompts in the Inventor Add-in](GUID-CE294AD5-D8E6-44BE-8CAC-96F735738B31.htm) for more information.

### Replace with Copy or Replace with Copy including Drawing

Note: These instructions for Replace with Copy including Drawing assume that the drawing only has one base view. If the drawing has two base views, see the procedure following this one.

1. In an open Inventor Assembly, click Replace with Copy or Replace with Copy incl. Drawing on the Data Standard ribbon.
2. Select the component that you want to copy from the Inventor Browser.

   If the component is not checked out to you or you do not have the latest version or the component is not in a vault, you are asked if you want to proceed. Click OK.

   Note: The base part of a derived part and 3rd party OLE references are not copied and replaced.
3. Enter the desired information on the Copy dialog and click OK.
4. If there are multiple instances of the selected component in the assembly, decide whether you want to replace one or all instances.
5. If the component is used as base view and you selected Replace with Copy incl. Drawing, the Copy Dialog displays for the Drawing as well.

   Enter the desired information and click OK.
6. Click OK.

   The selected component is copied and the reference is replaced with the copy.

### Replace with Copy Including Drawing When the Drawing Has Two Base Views

If the drawing you want to copy and replace inside an assembly has two base views, you must perform additional steps to replace with copy. For clarity, we will use example names in parentheses.

1. Open the assembly (assembly1.iam) and click Copy on the Data Standard ribbon to create a copy of the assembly (assembly2.iam).
2. In the copied assembly (assembly2.iam), select the component (Part1.ipt) and click Replace with Copy on the Data Standard Ribbon.
3. The Data Standard dialog for the component displays. Fill in the necessary information and click OK.

   A copy of the component (part2.ipt) is created and replaced in the assembly (assembly2.iam).
4. The Data Standard dialog for the related drawing displays. Enter the necessary information and click OK.

   A copy of the drawing (drawing2.dwg) is created and the view of the component (part2.ipt) is replaced in the drawing (drawing2.dwg). However, the reference to the base view to the original assembly (assembly1.iam) is still in the new drawing (drawing2.dwg).
5. Open the new drawing (drawing2.dwg) and select Replace Model Reference in Inventor. Replace the original assembly (assembly1.iam) with the copied assembly (assembly2.iam) manually.

The drawing (drawing2.dwg) now contains the views to the copied assembly (assembly2.iam) and to the copied component (part2.ipt).

## Modify an Existing Datasheet

You can change the data on a datasheet after it is created.

1. Open the file for which you want to modify the datasheet.
2. Click Datasheet on the Data Standard ribbon.
3. Make your changes and click OK to save your data.

   Note: The OK button remains disabled until all required fields are filled in.

### Change the Working Folder

# Change the Working Folder

Specify a different working folder.

You can browse the working folder, specify a different working folder, or set up a shared working folder for multiple users.

## Understand Working Folders

The working folder contains read-only copies of files that have not been checked out from a vault. When a file is checked out, the checked out version from the vault replaces the file in the working folder and becomes read-write for editing. When the file is checked back into the vault, the local version in the working folder returns to read-only.

A working folder location is defined by default, allowing you to begin working with a vault right away. The default working folder is:

* My Documents\Vault

If you are using Civil 3D, the default working folder is:

* C:\Civil 3D Projects

Important: Do not move files from the local working folder after they have been checked out. Files checked out to the working folder must always be checked back into the vault from the same working folder.

## Map a Vault Folder to a Different Working Folder

You can change the working folder for a specific folder and its contents on the Details dialog.

1. Right-click on a folder in the vault and then select Details.
2. In the Details dialog box, select the General tab.
3. To select a new working folder, click Working Folder and browse to a new location on the local computer.
4. To reset the assigned working folder to the default path of My Documents\Vault, click Default.

   Note: While you can override the default working folder location, if the administrator is enforcing the location, it cannot be changed.
5. If the folder is a library folder, it can be mapped to a shared server. To map a shared server to a library folder, enter a path in the Map to Shared Server field.

   Note: The Map to Shared Server location will be replaced in case the working folder is enforced by the administrator.

After changing the working folder in Vault, you need to re-connect to Vault.

The Map to Shared Server function is used only in AutoCAD to relocate AutoCAD designs at the network folder into Vault.

### Move Files

# Move Files

Use the Move command to move files from one folder to another. This does not effect any of the file information such as version history, children, or parents. All internal dependencies will not be updated until getting outside of Vault.

When moving files, there is no effect on the vault-related information, however you may effect how and if the file can be opened by the authoring application. Many tools embed folder structures into the file such as a relative or absolute path. Moving files can cause these links to break.

Notes:

* Moving Autodesk Inventor files outside the scope of project file may cause unresolved link when opening in Inventor.
* It is not possible to move a Revit file with references to another Revit file in vault.
* The project specified in Autodesk Inventor Project Settings will be used for file resolving.

## Move files in a vault

1. Select a file or files.
2. From the Edit menu, select Move to Folder.
3. In the Select Vault Location dialog box, browse for the new location in the vault and then click OK.

### Update File References

# Update File References

Update the file references for migrated files.

When adding a file to the vault from a CAD application, reference information which is used for updating files renamed or moved in Vault is automatically created. However, the files migrated from previous releases may be incomplete. You can see the parent or child in the Uses or Where Used tab, but a rename or move action will be blocked to protect the data. To resolve this issue, you can update file references before renaming or moving migrated files.

Note: The corresponding authoring application is required to run this command.

1. From the Actions menu, select Update File Reference.
2. Select a file, files or folder.

All file references are updated.

### Rename Files

# Rename Files

Rename a file in a vault.

When renaming files, the Rename Wizard may not update the related files which reference the files being renamed until getting the files outside of Vault (eg. Get/Check Out, Pack and Go and etc.). New file names can be specified in the Rename wizard or a naming scheme can be selected for renaming. A report listing the files that were renamed can be exported from the Rename Wizard. Only rename files in the vault using the Rename Wizard. Files being renamed must be checked into the vault before renaming.

Most files in the vault can be renamed using the Rename wizard, including Autodesk AutoCAD .dwg files as well as Autodesk Inventor .dwg files. Some file types can also be renamed using the Copy Design wizard. The version of a renamed file is incremented. The Comment field for each file effected by the rename process contains the comment "Rename" to annotate that point in the file history.

Note: iPart member files that use the key-based naming convention and custom iPart member files cannot be renamed. Automatically published visualization files are not supported. Automatically published visualization files are not directly supported.

Note: The project specified in Autodesk Inventor Project Settings will be used for file resolving.

You can rename files in a vault. When renaming files, the Rename Wizard may not update the related files which reference the files being renamed until getting the files outside of Vault (eg.

## Rename a File

You must be assigned the role of either Editor or Administrator to perform this action. Contact your vault administrator to verify your role.

Note: Files being renamed must be checked into the vault before renaming. iPart member files that use the key-based naming convention and custom iPart member files cannot be renamed. Automatically published visualization files are not supported.

**Notes:**

* Files being renamed must be checked into the vault before renaming. iPart member files that use the key-based naming convention and custom iPart member files cannot be renamed. Automatically published visualization files are not supported.
* It is not possible to rename a Revit file with references to another Revit file in vault. Vault cannot update the file reference in the parent file.

1. Select a file or files and then from the Edit menu, select Rename.

   The Rename wizard opens and lists the file or files that were selected from the main pane.
2. Click **[Add Files](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-A55AD9BD-1801-4BD8-8A36-C096F85018C4)** to include other files to be renamed.
3. Click Next.

   Related parent files will be updated on the next file download. If there are difficulties detected with updating certain related files, those files are listed in the Related Files tab.
4. Click Next.

   The files to be renamed are listed.
5. Click in the New Name box for each file to enter a new file name.
6. Click Numbering Scheme to assign a numbering scheme to selected files, add prefixes and suffixes, or modify the file name directly. You can turn off the default prefix to retain the existing file name.

   You can also copy paste values between multiple editable columns such as New Name, Update Part Number and Numbering Schema. This can save you a lot of time when working with large datasets.
7. Select Update Part Number to update the part number to reflect the new filename on renamed files.
8. Click Next.

   The files you selected are checked out, provided you have the permissions to do so, renamed, and the results shown.

### Rename Folders

# Rename Folders

Rename folders in a vault.

Renaming folder is considered as a path change operation to the files inside the folder. Therefore, the files referencing the files inside the folder are required to update when getting outside of Vault (such as Get/Check Out, Pack and Go and so on).

Before renaming a folder, make sure all files in the folder are checked into the vault. If a file in the folder is checked out, then the folder cannot be renamed.

After renaming a vault folder that is part of an Autodesk Inventor project, edit the Autodesk Inventor project file, .ipj, to map the project to the new folder name.

## Rename a Folder

1. Right-click on a vault folder and then select Rename.
2. Enter a new name for the vault folder.

If the vault folder is part of an Autodesk Inventor project, open Autodesk Inventor and edit the corresponding project file, .ipj, to reflect the name of the new folder.

### Replace Files

# Replace Files

The Replace command changes the references in a parent file to point to a different child file.

Note: You must have permission to check out all related files before replacing a file.

The file being replaced is not removed from the vault, versioned, or modified in any way. Only the immediate parent files are changed to reference the new file. As a result, a new version of the parent file is created. Previous versions of the parent file will reference the old file. New versions of the parent file will reference the new file.

The immediate parent files of a file being replaced must be checked in before replacing a file. Replacing a file requires that the necessary add-in for the parent file is installed so that the parent file can be repaired to use the new reference.

Note: AutoCAD xrefs contained in Autodesk Inventor .dwg files can be replaced using the Replace command. Autodesk Inventor .dwg and .idw files that do not have parents cannot be replaced.

## Replace Files

Note: You must have permission to check out all related files before replacing a file.

1. Select a file or files and then from the Edit menu, select Replace.

   Note: It is recommended that you select the leading version of the latest revision of a file when replacing it to ensure that the most recent data and file references are included.
2. The wizard lists the file or files that were selected from the main pane. Click Add Files to include other files from the vault.

   To exclude a file from being replaced, select it from the list and then click Remove.

   * If any of the selected files cannot be replaced due to restrictions in the vault, a list of restricted files is displayed. Select a file in the list to see the reason for that file being restricted.
   * If some of the files can be replaced, you are prompted whether to continue or not. Click Yes to continue replacing the files that are not restricted.
3. Click Next.
4. In the Identify Parent Files screen, the immediate parents affected by the change are listed.

   * By default, all of the parent files are selected. Turn off the check box next to a parent file to exclude it from being repaired with the new reference. Expand a parent file to see which of the files to be replaced will cause the parent to be repaired.
   * If the parent file is currently checked out or the necessary add-in for the parent is not installed, the parent is identified with an asterisk and red text. Click Back to remove the file to be replaced from the list or verify that the Autodesk Vault add-in for the parent file's application is installed. If one parent cannot be repaired, then none of the parent files will be repaired. You must resolve the issue before repairing any of the parent files.
5. Click Next.
6. The Specify Replacement Files screen lists the old files to be replaced. For each old file, click the browse button, ..., in the New File column and select the replacement file.

   Note: The state of the replacement file does not matter. A replacement file can be a file that is already checked out. When replacing files in an Inventor assembly, the replacement file must be within the project workspace of the parent file. Using the recommended setup of a single project file for the vault will avoid this restriction.
7. Click Finish.
8. You are prompted that replacing a component in an assembly may break constraints in Autodesk Inventor assembly files.

   * Click Yes to continue with the replacement.
   * Click No to return to the Replace Wizard.
9. The final screen of the Replace Wizard displays the results of the replace operation. The report lists the files that were replaced and the parent files that were repaired to include the new reference.
10. You can choose to generate a report as a text file and save it locally or in the vault by performing one of these options:

    * To save the report locally, click Save. On the Save As dialog, navigate to the folder structure where you want to store the file locally. Enter a name for the report and click Save.
    * To save the report in a vault, Click Send to Vault to display a list of vault folders. Select the vault in which you want the report saved, enter a name for the report, and click Save.

    The comment "Replace" is added to all files that have been replaced.
11. Click Close.

### Labels

# Labels

Throughout the design process, there are milestones that you want to capture. These milestones represent points in time such as customer proposals, design reviews, or concept variations. You can label these milestones so they can be easily identified.

Using labels, you can establish baselines and track marked progress for work-in-progress files. As the design progresses, you can also use these milestones to archive and retrieve past versions.

When you create a label, the most recent checked in version of every file in the project is assigned that label. If files within the project have child references outside of the current folder, those files are also assigned the label. There is no limit to the number of labels that can be assigned to a project. You cannot create more than one label with the same name.

Labels do not include folder information, only the project files are labeled. To help you identify the labeled project, include the name of the project in the label name and add a descriptive comment summarizing the extent of the label.

The Labels dialog box allows you to create new labels and view existing ones. You can also delete labels, rename labels, extract labeled files from the vault using Pack and Go, and restore labeled files. Labels can be viewed by anyone with permission to see labels.

## Manage Labels

All vault users can view labels; however, only user accounts assigned the role of Editor or Administrator can create and manage labels. The Labels dialog box is used to manage and view labels. Labels can be created, deleted, renamed, archived, and restored all from the Labels dialog box. The Labels dialog box also displays details about labels, such as who created it, when it was created, how many files are assigned to the label, and the comment associated with the label.

Assigning a label to a project creates a dependency between the project files and the corresponding label. Files associated with labels cannot be deleted from the vault unless the label is deleted first. When you delete a label, only the label is removed. The associated files remain in the vault.

No two label names can be the same. When naming labels, the following characters are restricted: \ / : \* ? " < > |

#### Extract Labels

# Extract Labels

Labeling a project allows you to archive or extract all of the project files that represent that milestone or baseline. By extracting the labeled project, you are capturing the project at a specific point in time. The captured project can then act as a roll-back target should it ever be necessary to return to the last labeled milestone.

## Extract a Label

Extract labels to cpature a project at a specific point in time. The captured project can then act as a roll-back target should it ever be necessary to return to the last labeled milestone.

1. From the Tools menu, select Labels.
2. In the Labels dialog box, select a label from the labels list.
3. Click Pack and Go.

#### Restore a Label

# Restore a Label

Because a label is applied to the entire project, it is a convenient way of restoring a project in a single operation rather than restoring individual files. Restoring a label returns the packed versions of the files associated with a label to the vault as the newest versions of the files.

By restoring a label, you can rollback a project should it be necessary to return to a previous milestone. For example, you can rollback the project to the versions of the files labeled as "Initial Design" if the project has strayed too far off course or if the files have to be returned to the last known good state.

All of the files associated with the label must be checked in before restoring the label. Even files checked out to the person restoring the label must be checked in.

When a label is restored, all of the files associated with the label are restored to the vault. You cannot choose which files within the label are restored. The label represents the project in its entirety.

If you cancel the restoration process, the files that have been returned to the vault up to that point stay in the vault. The remaining files associated with the label are not restored.

## Restore a Label

Restore a label to return the packed versions of the files associated with a label to the vault as the newest versions of the files.

1. From the Tools menu, select Labels.
2. In the Labels dialog box, select a label from the labels list.
3. Click Restore.
4. You are prompted to confirm restoring the selected label and creating a new version of all the associated files. Click Yes.

The progress of the restoration is displayed. The files associated with the label are restored to the vault as the latest version.

## Copy Design

# Copy Design

Create new design objects by copying existing data within a vault with the Copy Design feature. Depending on which design application you are using, copying a design involves copying a drawing and its related files, copying an entire design structure along with the related 2D drawings for 3D models, or copying components of a design.

Copy Design is now a modeless dialog with a toolbar: It can now remain open while you use the Vault client for other commands as well as add files to be copied.

The Copy Design feature creates a copy of the design with the same structure as the source files. In the Copy Design dialog, you can choose which parts of an existing design to copy, reuse, reuse branch, replace, exclude, or detach.

Copy Design Dialog

![](../images/copy-design-dialog.png)

Note: If the files are modified as part of the copy design process, you must open the files using the Vault add-in within the appropriate CAD application after the copy design is completed. Rebuild and check the files back into the vault.

# Copy Design Interface

Learn about the Copy Design interface.

Copy Design is now a modeless dialog with a toolbar: It can now remain open while you use the Vault client for other commands as well as add files to be copied.

There are three major sections of the Copy Design dialog.

* [Toolbar](#toolbar)
* [Main View](#main-view)
* [Navigation Panel](#navigation-panel)

[Shortcut keys](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-4BE3063A-87E9-4B7A-9D64-BC67DC93C116) are available for all options in the Copy Design dialog.

## Toolbar

![](../images/copy-design-toolbar.png)

The toolbar consists of five menus - File, View, Actions, Options, and Help menu.

### File Menu

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Export** | Export to a desired location. Specify the location and format in the Save as dialog. |
| **Add Files** | Add the files that you want to copy to the main view.  See [Copy Design–Add Files](GUID-9FE0B924-943C-480E-A9B3-511CC93AC05F.htm) for more information. |
| **Clear Root Node** | You can remove the node and all children from the dialog using the Clear Root Node option from the right-click menu. This option is only available if you select the root node. |
| **Execute Copy** | Once everything is configured, click Create Copy to begin the copy operation.  Before you perform the copy operation, Copy Design checks the file name duplicates and user permission for the folder. |
| **Exit** | Click to exit the Copy Design dialog. |

### View Menu

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Panels** | Select which panels you want to display in the Copy Design dialog. |
| **Layout** | Customize how the main grid looks. You can select from three views:   * Tree View: Displays the assembly in an organize configuration which shows the hierarchy of the assembly and associated files in the copy process. It enables you to understand the relationship of all files involved in the copy process. The following operations are available in the Tree View: Find, Find & Replace, edit the file name, edit the file path, Set Numbering Scheme, drag & drop to the Numbering panel, set Copy Action, and drag & drop to the Folder panel. * List View: Displays all of the files associated with the file selected in the copy process. The following operations are available in the List View: edit the file name, edit the file path, Set Naming Scheme, set Copy Action, column filtering and grouping. * Folder View: Displays the destination folder where the new files are placed after the copy process is complete. The following operations are available in the Folder View: Find, Find & Replace, edit the file name, edit the file path, drag & drop to the Numbering panel, set Copy Action, and drag & drop to the Folder panel. |
| **Show Grid Lines** | Select to toggle the display of grid lines on or off in the grid. |
| **Show Banding** | Select to toggle the display of alternating color bands on or off in the grid. |
| **Show Drawing View** | By default, the selected model and any associated drawings are copied. When Drawing View is turned on, the view mode displays all associated drawings and you can configure the copy operation based on the drawings.  Drawings are now visible in the Documentation folder. Display it by selecting the Tree View.  Note: A status of **Auto** indicates that the drawing linked to the file receives the same action as the associated file. For example, if a file is marked for copy, the associated drawing receives the same new file name and save location during the copy event. |
| ****Show Children**** | Select whether to show or hide the model attachments and library files in the copy view.  By default, all library files and attachments are set for copy. However, you can assign different copy actions to children files by displaying them in the Copy Design view.  In the Show Children menu select which types of children files to show by choosing one or both of the following check-boxes:   * **Attachments** Select Attachments to show all file attachments.  Note: Files with the Design Representation and Design Visualization classifications are not copied and not visible in Copy Design. * **Include Library Files** Select Include Library Files to show all associated library files. |
| **Automatic Column Sizing** | Select to toggle whether or not columns adjust automatically to fit within the available view area. |
| **Find** | Select to find the text. You can search for the text in the main grid or the numbering panel. |
| **Find and Replace** | Enables you to find a desired text and replace it with a desired one. You can perform the operation in the main window or the numbering panel. |
| **Refresh** | Refresh the Copy Design main view to see the most recent changes to files or the design structure.  Note: If dependent files are cloaked, the following message displays: "Some of the children of the added object are inaccessible." An administrator must provide access to the dependent files. After obtaining access, refresh the Copy Design main view. |

### Actions Menu

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Copy All** | Select Copy All to designate all files in the main view for copy. |
| **Copy Top Nodes** | You can copy multiple design trees with one command. Selecting Copy Top Nodes sets all top level components to copy. |
| **Copy** | Select to copy selected files from the main grid. Hold the Ctrl key to select multiple files at once. |
| **Copy To** | Select to copy selected files from the main grid to a specified location. Hold the Ctrl key to select multiple files at once.  See [Copy To](GUID-904309D3-8006-48F0-AEC9-7B40CE6E93AD.htm) for more information. |
| **Copy Branch** | Enables you to copy a complete branch with all files maintaining the original folder structure. |
| **Copy Branch To** | Enables you to copy a complete branch to a specific folder maintaining the original folder structure. |
| **Reuse** | The file is reused without creating a copy. This is a great way to minimize duplicates of a file that must be used in more than one location of a design.  Reused files are not renamed with any assigned numbering scheme and retain all original properties. |
| **Reuse Library Files** | You can set the reuse action for the selected library file by using the action in the right-click menu. When this action is used, the selected library file initially set to copy will now be set to reuse.  Note: In the Copy Design, blank value for Action Column means the file is reused. This action is available in the right-click menu. However, it can only be accessed when a library file is selected. |
| **Reuse All Library Files** | This action will set all copied library files to reuse in the main grid. |
| **Reuse All** | Applies the reuse action to all the files in the main grid. |
| **Reuse Branch** | Applies the reuse action to the selected file and the entire file structure beneath it.  The specified files are reused in the destination structure and no copies are created. |
| **Reuse Branch Library Files** | This action will set all copied library files to reuse in the selected branch.  Note: This action is available in the right-click menu. However, it can only be accessed when a branch library file is selected. |
| **Replace** | Replaces the selected file with another file. The name of the copied file changes to the replacement file's name. The same file can be copied to multiple locations.  Note: The pending copy of a file can be used as a replacement.  See [Replace](GUID-053F130E-A4E4-4764-ACE0-6A23D33870AB.htm) for more information. |
| **Exclude** | Sets the Exclude action on the selected files. This action can only be used on parent documentation files. If this is set on any other file in the structure, that file will be reused during the copy operation.  The files that are marked with a status of Exclude are not copied or reused. |
| **Go To** | After the Copy operation, you can open the Source Folder, or Destination folder using the options in the right-click menu. |

### Options Menu

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Numbering Schemes** | Select Numbering Schemes to set which naming schemes are valid for use in your copy design configuration. You can also set the default numbering scheme.  See [Copy Design–Numbering Schemes](GUID-54272FDF-E145-4972-A900-2E197F8F9E71.htm) for more information. |
| **Action Rules** | Select to create, edit, and delete rules that apply to your copy operations. Each Rule Set contains a number of file behavior and property settings that can be applied to the copied file based on the source file.  See [Copy Design–Action Rules](GUID-BD61249A-26B6-49DB-A6E5-BE9F1F460CC8.htm) for more information about creating and editing rules. |
| **Always Reuse Library files** | By default, this option is turned off. When it is off, the Copy action on the library file node is available. The copy branch action will set the library files to copy, meaning the library files are not reused. When this option is turned on, library files are reused, even if they were set to copy before enabling this option. The Copy action on the library file node becomes unavailable, and the copy branch action will not set the library files to copy.  Note: This option selection is cached and maintained on the local client machine. |
| **Automatically Copy Parents** | When Automatically Copy Parents is turned on, the parent of each copied component is also copied.  Note: Disabling this option results in source assemblies being edited to include the new copied part. |
| **Link Drawings with Models** | When selected, the drawing connected to a model is copied to the same location and shares the same new file name as the model. The Auto action is set on the drawing.  Note: If more than one drawing is associated with the model, the copy process will prompt with an error stating that both drawings cannot have the same name, and the copy process will not execute. Exclude or rename one of the drawings to resolve the error. |
| **Remove All Attachments** | When selected, all attachments are removed from the newly created files. By default, all file attachments will get attached to the new file. |
| **Remove All BOM Objects** | **Remove All BOM Objects** - When this option is turned on, the BOM information inside of newly created files are removed during the copy operation.  Note: These files will not be able to be assigned to an item until they are updated inside of the CAD application. |
| **Select References** | By default, all component references are copied. When Select References is turned on, you can choose which references of a component are copied.  Note: Multi-select is not enabled when using Select References view. Any reference that is selected must have a unique action.  See [Select References](GUID-4A32FB5A-2C37-4815-815A-E20CD300ADF0.htm) for more information about creating and editing rules. |
| **Manage Distributed Option** | Select the Manage Distributed Options to set which options to distributed in your copy design configuration. You can also reset the options.  Note:  You must have an "Administrator" or "Configuration Administrator" role to manage and deploy distributed options. |
| **Configure Prompts** | Select the Configure Prompts to configure the default response for Stand-alone Copy Design dialogs, so that every time certain dialogs are displayed, your preferred response is the default selection. You can also specify which commands for Stand-alone Copy Design are automatically performed without prompting you for input, reducing the number of times you need to directly interact with the Stand-alone Copy Design dialogs.  Note:  This option is only for Stand-alone Copy Design |
| **Numbering Schemes** | Select Numbering Schemes to set which naming schemes are valid for use in your copy design configuration. You can also set the default numbering scheme.  See [Copy Design–Numbering Schemes](GUID-54272FDF-E145-4972-A900-2E197F8F9E71.htm) for more information. |
| **Action Rules** | Select to create, edit, and delete rules that apply to your copy operations. Each Rule Set contains a number of file behavior and property settings that can be applied to the copied file based on the source file.  See [Copy Design–Action Rules](GUID-BD61249A-26B6-49DB-A6E5-BE9F1F460CC8.htm) for more information about creating and editing rules. |
| **Automatically Copy Parents** | When Automatically Copy Parents is turned on, the parent of each copied component is also copied.  Note: Disabling this option results in source assemblies being edited to include the new copied part. |
| **Link Drawings with Models** | When selected, the drawing connected to a model is copied to the same location and shares the same new file name as the model. The Auto action is set on the drawing.  Note: If more than one drawing is associated with the model, the copy process will prompt with an error stating that both drawings cannot have the same name, and the copy process will not execute. Exclude or rename one of the drawings to resolve the error. |
| **Remove All Attachments** | When selected, all attachments are removed from the newly created files. By default, all file attachments will get attached to the new file. |
| **BOM Objects** | **Remove All BOM Objects** - When this option is turned on, the BOM information inside of newly created files are removed during the copy operation.  **Remove BOM Objects from Parents Only** - When this option is turned on, the BOM information inside of the newly created parent files are removed during the copy operation. By default, Remove BOM Object from Parents Only is turned on.  Note: These files will not be able to be assigned to an item until they are updated inside of the CAD application. |
| **Select References** | By default, all component references are copied. When Select References is turned on, you can choose which references of a component are copied.  Note: Multi-select is not enabled when using Select References view. Any reference that is selected must have a unique action.  See [Select References](GUID-4A32FB5A-2C37-4815-815A-E20CD300ADF0.htm) for more information about creating and editing rules. |

## Main View Grid

![](../images/copy-design-main-grid.png)

The main Copy Design view shows the name of the files available for copy, destination folder, the action that will be performed on the file, the revision and state of the file, and how many instances (count) of the file occur within the current list. Whether you are duplicating a drawing, a complete design structure, or individual components, you can edit key properties during the copy process by using the intuitive copy/paste functionality or importing directly from Excel.

Tip: By default, reference file names are set to the destination file name when an action is assigned. You can view the [Numbering Panel](GUID-02EB242B-3766-4CDC-91D9-6B04FF94F028.htm) to identify files by original name or add File Name (Historical) to the main view.

You can also manage copy actions and [customize the view](GUID-3F0DE093-7180-499A-AEBD-F0BA9F94F31A.htm) from the main view.

## Navigation Panel

Simplify your copy design interface by undocking panels, changing the docking location, or turning off panels so that they do not display.

There are four different navigation panels.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Where Used** | The Where Used panel lets you track the origin of the copy objects and their destination.  Since you can replace existing files with uncommitted instances of files that are being copied, this means that the copied instance may have numerous destinations. Use the Where Used tab to make sure that the files are being copied to the right locations.  See [Where Used Panel](GUID-090F4509-82E5-4903-B33E-C836F41D84D2.htm) for more information. |
| **Actions** | The Actions Panel lets you review which operations are assigned to be performed on files in the main view.  Once you have configured the files in the main view, you can use the Actions Panel to filter the files based on their assigned operation. Assigned operations include copied, reused, replaced, excluded, removed, or edited.  Note: You can also set action operations by dragging and dropping files from the main grid onto the desired operation button in the Actions Panel.  See [Actions Panel](GUID-8301657D-E2BC-45F8-8CE4-01D7C28D97E4.htm) for more information. |

#### Copy Design – Drawing View

# Copy Design – Drawing View

Drawing View is a configuration mode that lets you assign individual copy actions to drawings.

Check the Drawing view option in the menu to display the drawings in the main grid.

## Default Behavior for Associated Drawings

Use the view to access and assign individual copy actions to drawings. The linked action is denoted by a value of **Auto** in the Action column.

For example, if a file is marked for copy and the associated drawing is marked as Auto, the drawing receives the same new file name (with the suffix (1), (2), (3), etc.) and save location as the associated file when the copy operation completes.

![](../images/copy-design-drawing.png)

In Model View, documentation set to **Auto** takes the same name as the dependent file being replaced or copied. This can result in file name duplication. Go to View > Show Drawing View to turn on the Drawing View to help resolve file naming conflicts.

#### Copy Design – Customize the View

# Copy Design – Customize the View

Customize how your Copy Design application looks.

Customize the layout by:

* Adding, removing, and rearranging column fields
* Toggling grid lines and banding on and off
* Enabling automatic column-sizing.

Note: You can also select which Navigation Panels display and which navigation buttons are displayed. See [Copy Design - Interface](GUID-9865E786-4FE2-40AC-B951-1FEBA910ECCC.htm) for more information.

## Customize Columns

The columns displayed in the grid represent the properties for that object in the vault. You can customize which columns are displayed and the order in which they are displayed.

### Arrange Columns

* Drag a column header to a new position between any two headers in the grid. The arrows indicate the new position for the selected column.

### Add Columns

1. Right-click on a column header and then select Choose Columns. The Choose Columns dialog lists the properties that are available for displaying in the grid.
2. From the drop-down list, select the object-type from which you want to select columns. Select All to view all the possible properties.
3. Drag-and-drop a column from the Choose Columns dialog into the header row for the grid. You can place the new column between any existing columns in the layout.

Tip: By default, reference file names are set to the destination file name when an action is assigned. You can view the [Numbering Panel](GUID-02EB242B-3766-4CDC-91D9-6B04FF94F028.htm) to identify files by original name or add File Name (Historical) to the main view.

### Remove Columns

Important: It is recommended that you do not disable the Actions or Status columns. Disabling these columns removes the copy action assigned to the file and the copy operation results, respectively, from view.

* Drag a column header out of the grid and release it. The cursor changes to an "X" indicating that the column will be removed from the layout when the mouse button is released.
* Right-click on a column and then select Remove This Column. The column is removed from the grid layout.

### Reset Columns

* Right-click on a column header and then select Reset Columns to return the grid layout to the factory defaults.

### Sort the View Based on a Column

* Click on a column head to sort files in ascending or descending order based on the file's values in that column while still retaining the model structure.

**Click on the column title again to reverse the order.**

### Create a Quick List

Create a list of frequently used columns for a fast way to add back to the main view.

* Right-click on the title of the column that you want to add to the Quick List and select Quick List.

  The column is added to the Quick List.
* To add a column to the view, right-click on the title of any existing column, select Quick List, and select the column that you want to add back to the view.

  Tip: Click the red X next to an option in the Quick List to delete it from the list.

## View Options

Right-click a column header and select View from the context menu.

Or, expand the View menu to display the options.

* Select Show Grid Lines to toggle the display of grid lines on or off in the grid.
* Select Show Banding to toggle the display of alternating color bands on or off in the grid.
* Select Automatic Column Sizing to toggle whether or not columns adjust automatically to fit within the available view area.

#### Copy Design – Select References

# Copy Design – Select References

Select References is a configuration mode that lets you assign individual copy actions to component references.

Tip: By default, reference file names are set to the destination file name when an action is assigned. You can view the [Numbering Panel](GUID-02EB242B-3766-4CDC-91D9-6B04FF94F028.htm) to identify files by original name or add File Name (Historical) to the main view.

## Default Behavior for Component References

By default, all component references are copied. When Select References is turned on, you can choose which references of a component are copied instead of copying all component references.

Note: Multi-select is not enabled when Select References is turned on. Any component reference that is selected must have its own unique action.

## Turn Select References On or Off

Turn on Select References to be able to assign individual copy actions to component references.

* In the Options menu click Select References to turn it on.

  A check mark beside the option indicates that it is turned on.

  Select the option again to turn it off.

Note: Actions set in reference mode are independent of one another. Copying multiple instances of a component will create multiple new files. Use [Replace](GUID-053F130E-A4E4-4764-ACE0-6A23D33870AB.htm) with pending data to reference a new file instance multiple times.

Note: If dependent files are cloaked, the following message displays: "Some of the children of the added object are inaccessible." An administrator must provide access to the dependent files. After obtaining access, refresh the Copy Design main view.

You can select one file or multiple files by holding down the SHIFT or CTRL key.

Important: AutoCAD Electrical users should select the electrical project (WDP) and not just the drawings. In addition, all project support files (WDT, WDL, AEPX) should have the same name as the project file.

When you have selected all of your files, click Open to add them to the main view of the Copy Design interface. Files in the main view can be configured with restrictions or additional behaviors that apply only to the copy operation.

Important: Beware that all versions selected from the history pane are considered as historical versions and that includes the latest version of the file if they are in the same selected list. The relationship settings are different from those used when executing a copy from the main grid.

#### Copy Design – Action Rule Sets

# Copy Design – Action Rule Sets

A rule set is a collection of property rules that determine file property behavior during a copy operation.

![](../images/copy-design-dialog-action-rules.png)

Rule sets can be used to:

* Reset the category of a target file
* Map file properties
* Clear or reset file properties

During a copy operation, only one rule set can be [applied](GUID-01F80FA2-A37C-467F-A929-35A53DAE8C7B.htm) to the selected data set. For this reason, a rule set can contain a number of rules that determine the settings of multiple file types based on extension, properties, or use.

## Default Rule Sets

An out-of-the-box default rule set is provided as the default rule set. The default rule set is configured to function similar to the old copy design by:

* Using the part number as a new file name
* Resetting the category of the file so that the new file category assignment rules are applied.

Note: The default rule set cannot be modified or deleted.

## Defining Rule Sets

A rule set contains one or more rules. Each rule is defined by one or more conditions that, if met, assigns certain file properties and behavior settings to the destination files.

Important: If a rule has more than one condition, all conditions must be met for the resulting property behavior to be applied.

Rules are created, edited, and deleted on the Define Rule Set dialog.

![](../images/dialog-cd-defineactionruleset.png)

## Define Rule Set Dialog Interface

Refer to the following table for information about the Define Rule Set interface.

| Reset All check box | Resets the source file behaviors on the destination file. The destination file has the same properties and behavior settings as a new file that has been added to Vault. |
| Property drop-down menu | The property for which you want to property behavior criteria. |
| Action drop-down menu | The action that you want applied to the selected property on the destination file.  Action options are:   * *Reset*–resets the property value on the destination file to that of a new file that has been added to Vault. This value may be a default value or blank, depending on the selected property. * *Set Blank*–clears the property value in the destination file and leaves it blank. Even if a default value is set for new files in the assignment rules, this property remains blank. * *Set Value As*–enables the Value drop-down menu so you can identify the value to be applied to this property in the destination file. * *Copy Value From*-enables the Value drop-down menu so you can copy the property value from the selected file. |
| Value drop-down menu | The value that you want to use for the selected property in the destination file.    Available values are:   * *File Name*–The destination file name without the extension. * *User*–The account name of the user currently logged in. * *Display Name*– The display name of the user currently logged in. * *Original File Name*–The source file name. * *Copy date*–Date the file was copied. * *Remove iLogic Rules*–value is a text data type with the string Removed. |
| Add | Click Add to add the defined property behavior to the rule. |

### Copy Design Walkthrough

# Copy Design Walkthrough

This topics walks you through a typical copy design workflow using the Copy Design stand-alone application.

1. In the Vault client, right-click on the file you want to copy and select Copy Design.

   Note: If you start Copy Design from the main file grid, it will get the latest of all files by default. This is the same as the Get behavior. However, starting Copy Design from the Uses tab is revision specific. If you want to copy a particular version of a file, right-click on the version from the History tab and select Copy Design.

   The Copy Design dialog opens.

   Note: If dependent files are cloaked, the following message displays: "Some of the children of the added object are inaccessible." An administrator must provide access to the dependent files. After obtaining access, refresh the Copy Design main view.
2. Click **Add Files** ![](../images/icon-add-files.png) from the **File** menu on the toolbar to add additional files for copying. Select the files that you want to copy and click Open.

   Important: AutoCAD Electrical users should select the electrical project (WDP) and not just the drawings. In addition, all project support files (WDT, WDL, AEPX) should have the same name as the project file.

   The files are added to the [main view](https://help.autodesk.com/view/VAULT/2026/ENU/?guid=GUID-9865E786-4FE2-40AC-B951-1FEBA910ECCC#main-view) of the Copy Design dialog.
3. In the toolbar, click **Actions**, and select the desired operation for the files listed in the main view.
4. If you want to perform a different action on a file, right-click on the file and select the action from the context menu. If you want to edit the key user-defined properties during the copying process, click the property value to edit.

   Tip: Click Refresh at any time to capture the latest version of the listed files and file structure.
5. To select the rule set that you want to apply to the copy operation, click Options > Action Rules, and select a desired rule from the list. Or, click **Define** ![](../images/icon-define.png) [to define a new action rule](GUID-A1FF8A08-C22B-47DE-90B1-ADDEC921EBC3.htm).
6. Once everything is configured, click [Execute Copy](GUID-A1FF8A08-C22B-47DE-90B1-ADDEC921EBC3.htm) ![](../images/icon-execute-copy.png) on the toolbar to start the copy operation.

   Several pre-checks are performed to ensure that:

   * All files have unique names (by Folder)
   * Vault unique file name rules are met
   * Selected files still exist
   * Files requiring edits are write-enabled
   * Files requiring edits are owned by the workgroup site

Note: When copying files with the same name into the same folder, and auto renaming is selected, the prefix "Copy of" is added to the first copy without a suffix, and all subsequent copies have that prefix followed by the suffix "(2)", "(3)", etc.

All successful copy operations receive a green check in the main view. If a copy operation failed, a red cross is displayed.

During a copy operation, if there are any files with restrictions, a warning dialog displays a list of restricted files highlighted in red. Hover over the red cross icon on each highlighted row to view the warning detail. You can export the restricted file list to an external file (xls, xlsx, txt, htm, html) for reference.

To perform another copy operation, modify your settings and click **Execute Copy**.

### Copy Design Property Write Back Issues

# Copy Design Property Write Back Issues

While using Copy Design some file properties may not be updated due to property write back failure. Below is a list of error types that may appear during copy design.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| *Error Type* | *Description* |
| Success | (no message) |
| NotSupported | The file type isn't supported for properties update. |
| AccessError | You don't have access to update the file. |
| CorruptionError | The copied file is corrupted. |
| ProviderNotFound | The file type isn't supported for properties update. |
| Error | File properties can't be updated. |

A warning is displayed when properties cannot be updated or are missing on files. If the properties are not needed then you can ignore the warning.

**Warning message: "Some properties could not be updated for the copied files."**

There are mappings between Vault properties and the file properties. Copy Design attempts to synchronize properties but the action fails if the property does not exist on the files in Vault (Vault property mappings are set to Create = "No").

![](../images/copydesign-propertyfailure.png)

To resolve the property update failure warning:

* Use templates that have all the required file properties to create files.
* Set the property mappings to Create = "Yes" for the required properties.

Note: If you do not want to add a specific property to the copied file (for example, property is specific to the assembly files and the copied file is a drawing) create a separate category for that type of files that is not linked to that property.

### Set Reuse Library Files in Vault Copy Design

# Set Reuse Library Files in Vault Copy Design

You can set reuse library files to drive design reuse.

By default, the option “Show Children” > Library Files” in the View menu is set to ON. This setting persists in the Copy Design dialog.

To **Reuse Branch Library Files**

1. Open the Copy Design dialog and ensure the “Show Children” > “Library Files” option in the View menu is selected.
2. Select a branch in the Copy Design.
3. Right-click on the branch row or choose Actions menu
4. Select the “Reuse Branch Library Files” action.

Following these steps, all library files in the selected branch will be set to reuse.

To **Reuse All Library Files**

1. Open the Copy Design dialog and ensure the “Show Children” > “Library Files” in the View menu is selected.
2. Select Actions menu
3. Select the “Reuse All Library Files” action.

After performing these steps, all library files in the main grid will be set to reuse.

Note: In the Copy Design, blank value for Action Column means the file is reused.

## Always Reuse Library Files

You can configure the system to always reuse library files.

By default, this option is turned off. When it is off, the Copy action on the library file node is available, and the copy branch action will set the library files to copy, meaning the library files are not reused.

When this option is turned on, library files are reused, even if they were set to copy before enabling this option. The Copy action on the library file node becomes unavailable, and the copy branch action will not set the library files to copy.

1. Open the Copy Design dialog
2. Select the Options menu and select the “Always Reuse Library Files”.

After performing these steps, library files in the main grid will always be set to reuse.

Note: This option selection is cached and maintained on the local client machine.

## Copy Folder

# Copy Folder

Copy the folder structure within a vault without copying files.

Use the Copy Folder functionality to copy folders, including subfolders, folder permissions, and properties to efficiently start a new project from a previous folder structure. It is an effective way to consistently organize your data across many projects.

Note: You need certain permissions to perform the copy folder operation. Administrator may need to create a special role with required permissions for the copy folder action, see [Roles and Permissions](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-269FDA08-F0C0-47E8-92DA-D832E03F827A).

Important: This topic is intended for Vault Professional users.

To copy a folder structure:

1. Right-click the folder you want to copy and select Copy Folder. Alternatively, click the Copy Folder icon on the Vault ribbon. The Copy Folder dialog opens.
2. Enter the new folder name.

   Note: Only the main folder name will be renamed to the new folder name at the copy location and all subfolders, if selected, will retain the subfolder name.
3. Select the folder location.

   * Click the ellipses (...) button next to the Copy To field to select the destination location.
   * Click OK.
4. Select the Working Folder check box to download a copy of the folder structure to a local working folder.
5. Optionally, select the check box to include:

   * Subfolders: Select to copy subfolders along with the main folder to the destination folder.

     Note: You need "Folder Read" and "Folder Create" permissions to copy folders and subfolders.
   * Permissions: Select to copy folder permissions. Subfolder permissions are also copied if the Subfolders check box is selected.

     Note: You need "ACL Read" and "ACL Write" permissions for this option.

     The Category applies state-based permissions the folder is in.
   * Properties: Select to copy folder properties. Subfolder properties are also copied if the Subfolders check box is selected.

     Note: You need "Folder Add & Remove User Defined Property" permission for this option.

     The source folder's category is always copied irrespective of this check box selection. By selecting the Properties check box, other properties (values) are copied.
6. Click Copy to initiate the copy folder operation or click Cancel to terminate the copy folder action.

   If you need to terminate the copy operation during the copy progress, click Cancel.

   Note: If you select Cancel, some folders may have been copied to the destination folder. You can delete or rename the folder at the destination location to avoid duplicate folder name issues that may arise at the time to retrying the copy folder operation.
7. Click Done once the copy operation is complete.

Note:

* Files and folder links are not copied while copying the folder structure.
* Library folder and subfolders can be copied into the library folder and subfolders only. Similarly, the general folder and subfolders can be copied only into the general folder and subfolders. You cannot copy library folder and subfolders into general folders, and vice versa.

### Pack and Go

# Pack and Go

Pack and Go collects a file and all of its referenced files into a single package and sends it to either a folder outside the vault or to a mail recipient.

All files that are referenced by a selected file are included in the package unless otherwise specified in the Pack and Go dialog box.

Note: If an Autodesk Inventor .dwg file is selected, the associated .ipj file is included in the pack and go package.

In Vault Professional, you can also use Pack and Go to package all of the files associated with the specific revision of a top level item.

All of the associated files or both the associated files and attached files can be included.

**Use Pack and Go to:**

* archive a file structure
* copy a complete set of files while retaining links to referenced files
* isolate a group of files for design experimentation
* send a data set to mail recipients
* extract a data set that makes up a specific revision of an item and its bill of materials

**A Pack and Go package can be:**

* a compressed Zip file
* uncompressed
* a DWF package - a single .dwf file that contains a page for each .dwf file that has been selected
* a DWFx package - a single .dwfx file that contains a page for each .dwfx file that has been selected

  Note: Only .dwf files are included in a DWF package and only .dwfx files are included in a DWFx package. If both .dwf and .dwfx files are selected for packaging, only those matching the selected package type are packaged.A Pack and Go package can be sent to an e-mail recipient. The allowable size for e-mail attachments differs from network to network. Make sure you are not e-mailing an attachment too large for your e-mail server or your recipient's e-mail server to process.

A Pack and Go package can be sent to [Autodesk Drive](http://www.autodesk.com/help-drive-about-enu), [Autodesk Docs](https://help.autodesk.com/view/DOCS/ENU/?guid=About_Autodesk_Docs) or the [Fusion Hub](http://www.autodesk.com/help-fusion-about-enu) cloud drive. To access Autodesk Drive or the Fusion Hub, you must install [Desktop Connector](http://www.autodesk.com/connect-help-about-enu).

## Work with Transmittal Reports

A transmittal report can be included when sending packages. The transmittal report details the file name, revision, state, vault folder location, and date the version was created for each file.

The transmittal report header and display information can be customized using a report template authoring utility. A report template authoring utility is installed with the vault client.

Note: The Autodesk Report Template Utility is intended for advanced users who are familiar with XML and RDLC authoring applications.

A more sophisticated template authoring tool is required for custom visual layouts. See [link](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms252067(VS.80).aspx) for more information on client report definition files and recommended authoring tools.

The ReportTemplateAuthoritingUtility.exe file is located in C:\Program Files\Autodesk\<Autodesk Vault edition><year>\Explorer folder, where  is the name of the Autodesk Vault [edition](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-AC53CA07-BD55-4C7E-9483-288FFAAFCC9A), and Vault year is the release year of the product.

## Project Sync

# Project Sync

The Project Sync feature provides file and folder synchronization between Vault and supported Autodesk cloud drives.

Note: This feature is available only in Vault Professional. You must also have access to [Autodesk Docs](https://help.autodesk.com/view/DOCS/ENU/?guid=About_Autodesk_Docs) or [a Fusion hub](http://help.autodesk.com/view/FSNT/ENU/?guid=GUID-8C18EED5-0C11-4AD7-89C5-85A81EF8906C) to use Project Sync.

This capability enables Vault users to either automatically or manually synchronize files from a folder in Vault with a folder in a cloud drive. The synchronization can be configured to work in either direction or both directions providing simple and reliable two-way communications between project team members.

The Project Sync utility can be configured to perform synchronization in ways that best suit your needs. A synchronization can occur at a scheduled time each day, at specific time intervals, or on demand. Use the filter options to have even more control over which files are synchronized.

Important: [Autodesk Docs](https://help.autodesk.com/view/DOCS/ENU/?guid=About_Autodesk_Docs) use cases currently focus on data contained in a single file such as DWG and PDF. The following types of file references and relationships are not currently supported when using Autodesk Docs with Project Sync:

* Inventor references/relationship
* Revit references/relationship
* Microstation references/relationship

## Project Sync Commands

With Project Sync, two new commands are added to the Vault client:

* Upload to cloud drive
* Download from cloud drive

Each command adds a job to the [job queue](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-54BF5AD2-C2EE-490D-BFF8-495E12442F7F) which executes using the file(s) selected.

Note: Users need to be assigned the Document Editor Level 1 and Document Manager Level 1 roles and logged into the Desktop Connector to queue these jobs.

**Upload to Cloud Drive**

Selected files are added from the Vault server to the cloud drive based on the folder mapping configured on the Project Sync Settings dialog. If the file exists on the cloud drive already, a new version is added.

**Download from Cloud Drive**

Selected files are updated from the cloud drive to the Vault server. If the files are unchanged, then no new version is created in the Vault. If there are changes, then new versions are created as needed. Any files that are not already in the Vault are added.

### Job Types

The Project Sync feature creates jobs and adds them to the Job Queue to be executed automatically. Project Sync adds five new job types.

| Project Sync Command | Job Type |
| --- | --- |
| Upload to cloud drive (manual) | autodesk.vault.sync.manualupload |
| Upload to cloud drive (scheduled) | autodesk.vault.sync.scheduledupload |
| Download from cloud drive (manual) | autodesk.vault.sync.manualdownload |
| Download from cloud drive (scheduled) | autodesk.vault.sync.scheduleddownload |
| Bi-directional sync (scheduled) | autodesk.vault.sync.scheduledsync |

Refer to [Managing the Job Processor](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-DAE28A42-45C3-4501-9BF2-78EE2F42808D) for more information on job types.

## Revisions

# Revisions

It is important to understand how revisions work before performing any revise events on files.

With revisions, you can label a significant milestone or set of changes to a document and its related files. The label itself is the revision and the collection of files affected in that revision are considered a revision level. A revision level can be retrieved later so that a document and the version of the related files associated with that particular revision are preserved.

Note: See [Revision Scheme Administration](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-E38303DA-4DE5-4D70-99A7-EBDFB809B56D) in the Administrator's Tasks section for more information on configuring revision schemes.

## Understand Revisions

Review the following sections to learn more about revisions and how they work within the Vault environment.

Note: When revising a file, it is not possible to revise from a previous revision.

### What is a version?

A version is an iteration of a document and its meta-data that has been saved to the vault.

### What is a revision?

A Revision represents a significant milestone in the history of a File/Item and its related children. The collection of files affected in a revision is considered a revision level, which is stored as part of the assigned revision label. A revision level can be stored and retrieved, ensuring that a document, Item, and related files associated with that revision are preserved. The revision is usually marked with a single character, such as A or B.

A revision is created with the Revise command. Revisions can also be automatically generated through a Lifecycle State change.

When a revision is downloaded from a vault, only one version within that revision is used to represent the revision. If lifecycles are not used, then the version is always the latest within that revision.

### How are revision-controlled documents related?

When using documents that are related to each other, such as an assembly and its referenced components, a relationship is created between the specific revisions of those documents. When an assembly is checked into a vault, the revision of each of its components is recorded so that when that revision is recalled, each related document is retrieved using the recorded revision.

#### Editing a referenced file without creating a new revision

If a document references other files and those files are edited without bumping the revision, the referencing document will consume the edits. For example:

* Revision A of an assembly references revision B of a part.
* Changes are made to revision B of the part after revision A of the assembly has been checked in.
* The changes to revision B of the part will show in revision A of the assembly when it is next checked out.

#### Editing a referenced file after creating a new revision

If a document references other files and a new revision is created for one of those files, the referencing document still maintains a relationship with the original revision. For example:

* Revision A of an assembly references revision B of a part.
* A new revision of the part is created and labeled C.
* Edits are made to revision C of the part.
* The changes to revision C of the part will not show in revision A of the assembly when it is next opened from vault.

### What does it mean when a revision is marked as released?

When a version in a revision is marked as released, it is given priority over newer versions and will represent the revision. This prioritization is known as a **released bias** and is an option that can be turned off in several of the dialogs.

Let's take a simple example where assembly is at Rev A and part is at Rev B.

* Revision A of the assembly references revision A of a part.
* Version 2 of the part is Released.
* Part is revised to revision B.
* A new version 3 of the assembly is created but still uses revision A of the part.
* Revision B of the part is also getting updated but is not being used by the Assembly.

![](../images/assemblywithparts.png)

Note: Versions marked as released can never be purged from the system and can only be deleted by an administrator.

The "Latest Approver" property describes the user who approved/released the last revision of a document. If an Administrator changed some properties in Vault for the released file, the "Latest Approver" displays a user that released the version.

The "Latest Release Date" property describes the date and time when the last revision of a document was released.

Note: File versions created, e.g., by a user leveraging the Job Processor for property synchronization or from other extensions, will not update the information within the "Latest Approver" and "Latest Release Date" property.

### What does released biased mean?

Released bias indicates that released data should take priority over non-released data. It shows the latest file's version in the used revision. This option can be turned off.

Note: Released bias is enabled by default.

### What is the difference between Released bias and Revision bias?

Here is an example where we have an assembly and part both at Rev A.

![](../images/release-revision-bias.png)

* Released bias means that the display will use Rev A version 2 of the part and not version 3.
* Revision bias enforces that a Rev A of the assembly will always use Rev A of the part.

Let's see the Uses tab. The Uses tab lists the files used in the current model.

Click the view button ![](../images/release-biased-16.png) / ![](../images/non-release-biased-16.png) to toggle between released/non-released bias. Note that the view button is for viewing only; it doesn't change the state of the file/component.

* Released bias shows all the components as a Released state.
* Non-released bias shows the latest state of all the components.

The **Latest** represents the latest revision/version that the parent is linked to. The intent is to display the latest/version of every component associated with the parent. However, it does not necessarily mean that the parent is currently using that version.

The **Released** refers to the released version. The intent is to display the released version that is consumed.

![](../images/usestab-releasedrevisionbias.png)

* When the **Latest** is selected with the **Non-Released Biased** view ![](../images/non-release-biased-16.png), the Uses tab displays the latest file's version. It shows the current stage of all the components/sub-components.
* When the **Latest** is selected with the **Released Biased** view ![](../images/release-biased-16.png), the Uses tab displays the released file's version if available.
* When a specific **Revision** is selected with the **Non-Released Biased** view ![](../images/non-release-biased-16.png), the Uses tab displays the latest file's version in the used revision.
* When a specific **Revision** is selected with the **Released Biased** view ![](../images/release-biased-16.png), the Uses tab displays the file's released version in the used revision if available.

### What does leading or tip mean when referring to a version or revision?

The **leading version**, or **tip version**, is always the latest version of a file, even if Released Bias is enabled.

The **leading revision** , or **tip revision**, is always the latest version of the latest revision of a file, even if Released Bias is enabled.

### How do revisions and lifecycles work together?

When used in combination with lifecycles, revisions can be generated automatically after a predefined event occurs. For example, the administrator can configure it so that when a file is moved from a work in progress to review state, the system automatically creates a new revision of the file.

### What is a quick change?

A quick change is an edit made to a file without creating a new revision. Quick changes are invoked by setting a document's state to Quick Change and then modifying the file.

### Revise a Single File or Item with the Vault Client

# Revise a Single File or Item with the Vault Client

Change the revision value for a file or an item in the Vault client.

A revision indicates a milestone in the manufacturing process of a file or item. A revision can signify a point in time in the history of the lifecycle of the object.

When a file or item is created, an initial revision is assigned. This revision is represented by a letter, usually A. When a revision bump is performed, the letter increments according to the format specified in the assigned [revision scheme](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-E38303DA-4DE5-4D70-99A7-EBDFB809B56D). For example, a Revision of **A** would become **B**.

The History tab in a file displays all of the revision numbers of the file or item and any relevant attributes.

## Revise a File or Item

Use the Revise command to create a new revision from a historical or latest revision.

Note: The files must be checked in.

1. From either the main view or the preview pane, select the file or item that you want to revise.
2. Click **Actions > Revise** or click Revise on the document management toolbar. The Revise dialog is displayed with the version of the file or item you selected shown at the top.

   Note: Only items with BOM rows that are [turned on](GUID-7FEA3BEB-09DE-4225-9C59-798D4A7FD5C6.htm) are displayed.
3. In the Revise dialog box, select Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, or From user defined property from the Select Next Revision list.

   Note: If you would like to revise from a property, you must create a user-defined property (UDP) that points to the property as the source. Then when you revise, you can select From user-defined properties and select the UDP that you created.
4. Do one of the following:

   * Accept the proposed value from the Revision list.
   * Select another value from the Revision list.
   * Enter a value into the Revision field.
5. Click Include Dependents or Include Parents if you wish to include those files in the revision bump.
6. In the text box at the bottom, select comments from the drop-down list or enter comments about the revision directly into the box.
7. Click OK to perform the revision.

When the Revise command is used on a single file or item, the folder view shows the object's location in its vault. The Uses view has a single root node.

### Revise Multiple Files or Items with the Vault Client

# Revise Multiple Files or Items with the Vault Client

You can revise multiple files or items from either the main view or the preview pane in the Vault client. When selecting multiple files or items, only the latest version of each object is used as the source for the revision bump.

1. Revise files or items from either the main view or the preview pane by selecting each object that you want to revise.

   Note: The files and items must be checked in.

   * To select multiple files that are listed consecutively, hold the SHIFT key while clicking the range of files to select.
   * To select multiple files that are not adjacent to each other in the list, hold the CTRL key while selecting each file individually.
2. Click **Actions > Revise**, or select Revise from the document management toolbar.

   The Change Revision-Multiple Files dialog displays.

   In the file relationships view, each file with a check mark is affected. Clear the check box for any file you want to exclude from the revision command.

   Objects that are not the leading version of the leading revision will have disabled check boxes.

   Note: If you are revising items, only items with BOM rows that are [turned on](GUID-7FEA3BEB-09DE-4225-9C59-798D4A7FD5C6.htm) are displayed.
3. Select Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, or From user defined properties from the **Select Next Revision** list.

   Note: If you would like to revise from a property, you must create a user-defined property (UDP) that points to the property as the source. Then when you revise, you can select From user derfined properties and select the UDP that you created.
4. Do one of the following:

   * Accept the proposed value from the Revision list.
   * Select another value from the Revision list.
   * Enter a value into the Revision field.
5. Click Include Dependents or Include Parents if you wish to include those files in the revision bump.
6. In the text box at the bottom of the dialog, select a comment from the drop-down list or enter comments directly into the box.
7. Click OK to perform the revision bump.

When the Revise command is used on multiple files or items, the folder view shows each object in its respective vault location. The Uses and Where Used views show each object with its own root node.

### Revise a File or Item from a User-Defined Property with the Vault Client

# Revise a File or Item from a User-Defined Property with the Vault Client

You can revise a file or item based on an existing revision character associated with a user-defined property.

## Pre-Requisite for Revising from a User-Defined Property

If you would like to revise from a file or item property, you must create a user-defined property (UDP) that points to the property as the source. Then when you revise, you can select From user-defined properties and choose the UDP that you created.

Note: The revision character must adhere to the current revision scheme.

### Revise Files or Items from a User-Defined Property

1. Revise files and items from either the main view or the preview pane by selecting each object that you want to revise.

## Lifecycles and States

# Lifecycles and States

Use Lifecycles and States to automatically drive behaviors and differentiate file statuses in the design process.

A lifecycle definition is an engine that can be configured to automatically assign security, behaviors, and properties to Vault objects based on where the object is in the life of the design process. This functionality allows you to streamline your work environment by removing the overhead involved in managing groups of files, custom objects, or an entire project.

A lifecycle definition uses states to identify the object's status in the lifecycle. Examples of states are Work in Progress, For Review, or Released. An object moves from one state to another based on the lifecycle definition's transition rules. These transition rules determine when the state change happens, if it can occur manually or automatically (or both), based on criteria determined by the administrator. The lifecycle definition also determines if any other automatic behaviors occur based on a state change.

For example, a lifecycle definition can be configured to automatically revise a file when it moves from a Work in Progress state to a Review state. Or if a user changes a folder's status to obsolete, the lifecycle definition can automatically apply security settings to the folder so that only an administrator can modify the folder and its contents or reinstate it for use.

Note: Refer to [Lifecycle Definition Administration](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-088F0236-B5B7-4E35-B218-BD2D253B87F6) for more information. You must be an Administrator to define and modify lifecycles.

### Changing Lifecycles and States

# Changing Lifecycles and States

Learn about changing lifecycles and states in Vault.

The Change State dialog changes the state of files, folders, items, and custom objects. Multiple instances of any of those entity types can be acted on at one time. However, the Change State dialog does not support more than one entity type at a time. For example, the user cannot change state on a file and folder at the same time.

Note: You can change the lifecycle for a file in the Vault stand-alone client or change the state of a file in the Vault add-in for Inventor and AutoCAD as well as the stand-alone client.

**Parent page:** [Lifecycles and States](GUID-63CE799F-5E53-417C-9A6E-3F1987943D83.htm)


### The Change State Dialog in the Vault Client

# The Change State Dialog in the Vault Client

Learn about the Change State dialog in the Vault Client.

The Change State command allows users to modify the lifecycle state for files, folders, items, and custom objects. Changing the lifecycle state of a Vault object enforces certain lifecycle behaviors configured by the Vault administrator to occur. Examples of states include Work in Progress, Released, and Obsolete.

![](../images/dialog-changestate.png)

The relationship grid displays project data that was selected when the Change State command was chosen. The lifecycle definition and the lifecycle state is shown for each object listed in the grid and can be modified individually. Along the top of the dialog, the lifecycle definition filter drop-down, the lifecycle state drop-down, and the browse button are used for making bulk changes.

Choosing a lifecycle definition from the filter allows the user to make bulk state changes to all data that belongs to that lifecycle definition. Browse to another lifecycle definition to change the lifecycle definition that is assigned to the data in the grid. Only lifecycle definitions that are assigned to the category will be available in this dialog. The lifecycle state drop-down allows the user to change the state on more than one object at a time.

By default, all data in the relationship grid is checked by default and, as a rule, only the data that is checked is affected by the settings in this dialog. Any data that is unchecked ignores the changes that were set in the Change State dialog. See the Lifecycle Definition Filter and New Lifecycle State section for more information on these features.

## Changes to Data Made Are Shown in Bold Text

Changes to data made in this dialog are shown in bold text. This allows the user to easily see what data is going to change based on the settings of this dialog.

To change the lifecycle state of a file, choose the lifecycle state drop-down and select the desired state. The per file lifecycle state drop-down lists all available states within the given lifecycle definition (for-which-a-transition-from-the-current-state-to-the-listed-state-is-an-allowed-transition).

## Change the Lifecycle State for a Specific File

To change the lifecycle definition of a file, click on the "..." button in the lifecycle definition drop-down in the grid. A dialog display in which you can choose a new lifecycle definition for the file. The lifecycle definitions displayed in this dialog are all the lifecycle definitions assigned to the category to which that file belongs. When the user selects a new lifecycle definition and clicks OK, the selected file lists the new definition and its state is changed to the default state of the selected lifecycle definition.

This workflow is identical for project folders and custom objects as well.

## Learn About the Lifecycle Definition Filter and Batch Change State Updates

The lifecycle definition filter drop-down contains all of the lifecycle definitions that exist for the project data listed within the relationship grid. This filter is used in conjunction with the lifecycle state drop-down. The two fields are used to update all data within a given lifecycle definition to a new lifecycle state. If the user wants to change all of the project data in a given lifecycle definition to a new lifecycle state, here's the workflow:

1. In the lifecycle definition filter drop-down, choose the lifecycle definition for which you want to do a batch update.
2. In the lifecycle state drop-down, select the new state for the files assigned to that lifecycle definition. This action changes only the lifecycle state of files with the lifecycle definition specified in the lifecycle definition filter drop-down.

For example, if you want to change all files in the grid that are in the Basic Release Process to the Work in Progress state, choose Basic Release Process in the Lifecycle Definition Filter drop-down. At this point, no changes have been made to states within the grid. Next, choose Work in Progress from the lifecycle state drop-down. All files in the grid that have the Basic Release Process are changed to the Work in Progress state.

Note: If you change any of the relationship settings (e.g.,-include-dependents) while the Lifecycle Definition Filter has a lifecycle selected, and the New Lifecycle State has a new state selected, then any new files brought in as a result of the change to the settings will have their lifecycle state changed to the selected state if they are in the lifecycle definition specified in the Lifecycle Definition Filter.

## Select a New Lifecycle Definition

You can change the lifecycle definition of all of the project data in the file grid by clicking the "..." button to select a new lifecycle definition. The lifecycle definitions listed in select a Change Lifecycle Definition dialog are only those lifecycles which would be applied to every file in the file grid. That is, the dialog lists the intersection of lifecycle definitions that would be available for each file in the object grid. A lifecycle definition is considered available if that lifecycle is assigned to the same category as the object.

Once you select a lifecycle definition and click OK, all files within the grid are listed with the chosen lifecycle definition. Their states are also changed to the default state of the new lifecycle definition (unless-the-project-data-was-already-set-to-the-chosen-lifecycle-definition).

## Learn About Grid Views

The relationship grid has three views: Folder View, List View, and Design View

### Folder View

* The Folder View ![](../images/icon-folderview.png) shows the selected object and its hierarchy within the Vault. This view shows all of its parent and child folders (depending on related data available in the grid).
* Available for files and folders. The folder view is not available for custom objects.

### List View

* The List view ![](../images/icon-listview.png) shows a flat list of the selected data and any of the related data that is included in the dialog.
* Available for files, folders, and custom objects.

### Design View

* The Design view ![](../images/icon-designview.png) shows the child/parent relationship between files.
* This view is only available for files.

## Include Settings

You can select which relationships are included in the grid display by configuring the preferences in the Settings dialog. Access the Settings dialog by clicking the Settings ![](../images/icon-settings.png) icon on the Change State dialog.

In the Settings dialog, you can choose whether dependents, attachments, or library files are included in the relationship grid for the selected data. You can also control whether parents are displayed as well and if other related documentation is also listed.

Note: The settings dialog will change based on the entity type selected on the Change State dialog.

**Settings dialog for Custom Objects**

There is an option to include links to the Custom Object definition type. Only links to that custom object definition type can be included in the grid display.

You can also quickly select whether to include file dependents or parents for the selected files by clicking their respective icons.

* Click the Include dependents ![](../images/icon-includedependents.png) icon to display all descendants of the selected data.
* Click the Include parents ![](../images/icon-includeparents.png) icon to display the parents of the selected data.

## Include Links

As indicated in the previous section, links to entities can be included in the Change State operation. This allows a user to change the state of data that is linked into their project or custom object. For example, if a user has a Vault project configured that contains links to other folders, he or she can change the state of the folder, include sub-folders using the include dependents, and include any linked files by checking that box in the Settings dialog.

Links to data of other entity types cannot be included in the Change State event.

### Change States on Vault Objects in the Vault Client

# Change States on Vault Objects in the Vault Client

The Change State command in the Vault Client is used to change the status of a Vault data and its related files by reassigning the lifecycle state.

The Change State command can be accessed from three places:

* The Document Management toolbar
* The Actions menu on the Autodesk Vault menu bar
* The context-sensitive right-click menu

## Multiple Objects

Multiple files, folders, items, or custom objects can be selected for the Change State command. When multiple Vault objects are selected, Autodesk Vault examines the status of each object in the set. If any of the selected objects are not eligible for a state change, the Change State command appears unavailable on both the Actions menu and the context-sensitive menu.

Note: When multiple objects are selected, only those states which can be applied to all selected objects are available from the Select new lifecycle state list.

See [Learn About the Change State Dialog](GUID-EDEB51E5-9C8B-4A94-AA7F-F5C467CEA806.htm) for more information.

## Change a Lifecycle State

1. Select one or more Vault objects for lifecycle state reassignment. To select multiple objects, hold down SHIFT while selecting objects from the main grid.
2. Do one of the following:

   * Click Actions ► Change State.
   * From the Lifecycle Management toolbar, click Change State.
   * From the selected objects, right-click and then click Change State.

     ![](../images/dialog-changestate.png)
   * In the Change State dialog box, select the new state from the Select new lifecycle state list. The new state is highlighted in bold in the State column. When related objects are displayed in the table, the new state also applies to those them. Non-released biased revision relationships determine which children are affected. If a file is not the leading version of the leading revision, then the check box is disabled next to it.

     Note: Only items with BOM rows that are turned on are displayed.
   * Enter or edit comments in the Enter comments box, as needed or select from a list of previous comments using the drop-down list.
   * Click OK. The new state is applied to the selected objects. File versions are increased by one.

### Roll Back the Lifecycle State of a File

# Roll Back the Lifecycle State of a File

Return a file to a previous lifecycle state with the Roll Back Lifecycle State Change command.

When a file is rolled back, it:

* returns to the file version associated with the rolled-back state
* returns to the security, lifecycle definition, and revisions scheme associated with the rolled-back state
* retains any property definitions associated with the current version.

The current version of the file is deleted when the file is rolled back to a previous state.

## Rules for Rolling Back a File Lifecycle State

The lifecycle of a file can be rolled back if:

* the file is currently checked in.
* no parent versions consume the current child version that you want to roll back.
* the previous lifecycle state has not been deleted.
* the file is not in  definition.
* there is no label on the current version of the file.
* the administrator has not enabled the **Restrict File and Item Lifecycle State Changes to Change Orders** option.

See [Configure Restrictions for Lifecycle State Changes Using Change Orders](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-1DC7DCA0-EEC7-41AF-8AF6-59AD5AC10D27) for more information.

## Roll Back a File's Lifecycle State

You must be a Document Manager Level 2 or Administrator to roll back a file's lifecycle state.

1. Select a file in the main view and select Actions > Roll Back Lifecycle State Change.

   A dialog displays describing to which state the file will be rolled back.

## Categories

# Categories

Categories are labels that provide a way to group objects logically. Grouping by category also provides a means for assigning a defined set of behaviors and rules to objects.

A category can automatically assign user-defined properties to objects in the Vault. Categories can also be used to automatically assign lifecycle definitions or revision values to files.

**Default Category Assignment**

Files, folders, custom objects, and items do not necessarily have to be assigned to a category. Files, folders, custom objects, and items not assigned to a category then use the default behaviors defined for the vault.

**Category Configuration**

A category has associated properties and behaviors that are applied to an object when it is assigned to the category. Those behaviors are of three types:

* Lifecycles (files only)
* Revisions (files and items only)
* User Defined Properties (files, folders, and items)

## Change Category Workflows

You can change the category assignment for files, folders, custom objects, and items in the Vault client, and for files in the AutoCAD, Inventor, and Revit Vault add-ins.

### Change Categories in the Vault Client

# Change Categories in the Vault Client

The category to which a Vault object is assigned can be changed using the Change Category command.

The command can be accessed from the Action menu, or from the Lifecycle Management toolbar.

1. Select one or more Vault objects of the same entity class for category reassignment from the main view.

   Note: The change category command is available for all entity types in the Vault. The dialog will only support one entity type at a time. For example, the dialog will not change category of a file and a folder at the same time. These actions must be performed separately.
2. Do one of the following:

   * Click **Actions > Change Category**.
   * From the Lifecycle Management toolbar, click **Change Category**.
3. In the Change Category dialog box, select a new category from the list.

   Note: Only items with BOM rows that are turned on are displayed in the Name view.

   * Select **Apply assignment rules** to evaluate the selected objects by the assignment rule of the selected category.
   * Clear the check box for any object that should not change.
   * Add comments in the **Enter Comments** box.
4. Click **OK** to apply the change to the selected object(s).

### Change Categories for Files–AutoCAD

# Change Categories for Files–AutoCAD

You can modify the category for a file or group of files to collectively enforce a defined set of behavior, rules, and properties for the selected vault objects.

Behavior for a particular category can be changed by an administrator in the Autodesk Vault stand-alone client.

## Change a File's Category

Use the Change Category command to transfer a file or group of files from one category to another. When you change the category for a vault object, that object inherits the behaviors specified in the new category.

For example, a category called Engineering has a certain lifecycle definition assigned to it, and that lifecycle is configured to perform an automatic revision bump on files when a change state occurs. If a file is moved to the Engineering category and goes from the Work in Progress state to the Review state, the file will automatically undergo a revision bump based on its Category and the lifecycle definition assigned to it.

Note: See [Understanding Lifecycles](GUID-63CE799F-5E53-417C-9A6E-3F1987943D83.htm) and [Understanding Revisions](GUID-1FAD3749-175C-485F-A09E-41EA5D41E5CA.htm) for more information.

1. Select the file for which you want to change the category by performing one of these options:

   * In the Autodesk Vault ribbon, click Change Category .

     Note: This command affects only the file that is currently open.
   * In the ACAD > External References palette, right-click one or more files, and select Change Category.
   * In the Inventor > Vault Brower, right-click one or more files and select Change Category.

   The Change Category dialog box is displayed.
2. Select the new category from the list.
3. Enter any comments regarding the category change in the Comment field.
4. If you want to preview the changes, click the Expander button to preview the results. Files affected by the change category action are listed with their current category name and the new category name associated with the file(s).
5. Click OK to save the changes and close the Change Category dialog.

## Batch Plotting Files

# Batch Plotting Files

The batch plotting utility allows you to plot directly from a vault.

Use the Plot Manager dialog to build and manage large plot lists and to submit any number of plot jobs to a plotter or printer. The progress of submitted jobs is tracked using the Plot Monitor dialog. CAD files, Microsoft Office files, text files, and any other file type stored in the vault can be added to a plot list. Individual sheets from file formats that support sheets can be added to the list as well.

Batch Plot provides support for the following files:

* Microsoft Word (.doc, .rtf, .docx)
* PowerPoint (.ppt, .pptx)
* Excel (.xls, .xlsx)
* PDF (.pdf)
* Dwf (.dwf, .dwfx)
* AutoCAD (.dwg)
* Inventor (.idw, .ipt, .iam, .ipn, .ide, .dwg)

**Notes:**

* Batch Plot provides limited support for all other file extensions.
* Batch plot is not supported with AutoCAD LT or Inventor LT.
* Batch plot is not supported with Inventor View and DWG Trueview. A full version of Inventor or AutoCAD is required to run the batch plot command.

## Plot Command and the Plot Manager

The Plot Manager command is accessed from the File menu and is also available on the main toolbar. Files are added to the plot list through the Plot Manager dialog box. Any revision of any file can be added to the list. Select files from the History tab, the Where Used tab, or the Uses tab to create a plot list.

The Plot Manager dialog box enables you to manage the list of files to be plotted. Files can be added to the plot list or excluded from the list, the number of copies for each file in the list can be specified, and a printing device for each file in the plot list can be selected in the Plot Manager dialog. Individual sheets from within files that support sheets can be excluded from the list, as well, allowing you to print only the necessary sheets from a file. The page setup for each file can also be specified.

Each row in the Plot Manager dialog represents a file or sheet in the plot list. Plot lists can be saved, so you can create a list of commonly plotted files that can be opened and printed at any time. The plot list is organized by the following columns:

* File Type: the type of file
* File Name: the name of the file
* Revision: the file revision
* Plot Data: the file that will be used to create the plot
* Sheet Name: the name of the sheet within the file. If the file supports sheets, any number of sheets from the file may be added to the plot list. If more than one sheet from a file is added the plot list, the file containing those sheets is listed multiple times.
* Sheet Size: the actual size of the document.
* Copies: indicates how many copies of each file or sheet to print
* Device: indicates which plotting or printing device to which the file or sheet will be sent. Available devices can be selected from the drop down list.
* Page Setup: indicates if the file will be printed using the default page setup for the file or using custom page setup settings
* Plot Size: indicates the paper size for plotting.
* Scale: the size of the plot in relation to the page size
* Location: the location of the file within the vault

Note: The plot list can be sorted by any of the columns, allowing you to sort files and sheets by the size of the output, the device, and so on. Click on a column header to sort the list by the values in that column.

The Page Setup section of the Plot Manager enables you to view the default page setting for a file or create custom page settings. The Details pane displays a sample of the selected sheet using the current page settings. If the selected file has a .dwf file associated with it, the preview dynamically updates to reflect the page setup options. If no .dwf file exists, the preview is a static thumbnail image.

### Monitor Plot Jobs

# Monitor Plot Jobs

Learn about plotting jobs.

The Plot Monitor dialog box tracks the processing of the sheets before they are sent to the device. The list displays the order of the sheets in the plot job and tracks the progress of each sheet. Using the Plot Monitor dialog box, you can pause, stop, or continue processing plot jobs. Once files are sent to a printer or plotting device, use the Windows print manager to track the status of the output.

Each row in the Plot Manager represents a file or sheet from the plot list submitted using the Plot Manager. If multiple plot jobs have been submitted, the files and sheets for each job are grouped together by the job name. The sheet that is currently being processed is highlighted with a green border. A file or sheet that did not print is displayed in red text.

The list is organized by the following columns:

* File Name: the name of the file
* Sheet Name: the name of the sheet within the file. If the file supports sheets, any number of sheets from the file may be added to the plot list. If more than one sheet from a file is added the plot list, the file containing those sheets is listed multiple times.
* Status: the current status of each file or sheet:

  + - (dash): the file is waiting to be processed
  + Processing: the file is being prepared for plotting. Once the file is processed, it is sent to the specified printing device.

## Job Server

# Job Server

The process of creating and checking in visualization files manually can be time-intensive for some users, especially those responsible for managing large assemblies. The job server utility allows users to automatically create and check-in visualization files from their local workstation.

Note: You must be an administrator to enable the Job Server.

Users assign their publishing jobs to a job queue where they are stored until certain parameters are met. The job processor then creates the visualization files and checks them into the vault based on the publishing properties defined in the Global Settings dialog.

Administrators can manage the job server by tracking jobs, re-submitting stalled jobs, and deleting unnecessary jobs. Refer to [Job Server Administration](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-41C25A0B-81DC-4E5B-B98B-3EA7B280CD97) for more information on Administrator's tasks and for a deeper examination of the Job Server component.

**Job Server Components**

The Job Server consists of two components:

1. **Job Queue** - A list, or queue, of jobs submitted by clients (inventor,-autocad,-vault,-autoloader) waiting to be processed. This queue is stored in and managed by the Vault Server.
2. **Job Processor** - is a separate application that reserves queued jobs and pulls them from the job server to process them. Since the job processor is installed along with the vault client, any workstation with Autodesk Vault Professional can be used to process jobs.

You can sign into your Autodesk Account through the Job Processor. Click [here](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-2618B248-133F-4B23-AE91-F3209E3E05C2) to learn more.

## How It Works

Jobs are submitted to the job server when:

* A user checks in a file which needs a visualization file created.
* A user invokes an Update View command inside of the Vault client application.
* Autoloader is used to load files into the vault and visualization files are needed.
* A status change occurs on a file and an updated visualization file is needed.
* A user invokes Create PDF, Create DXF, or Create STEP command inside of the Vault client application.
* A status change occurs on a file and an updated PDF, DXF, or STEP file is needed.
* A status change occurs on a file and a custom job is needed.
* A status change occurs on a file and properties need to be synchronized in the file.

### Job Processor

# Job Processor

The Job Processor is a separate application that reserves queued jobs and pulls them from the job server to process them. Since the job processor is installed along with the Vault client, any workstation with the Autodesk Vault edition can be used to publish jobs.

From the Job Processor dialog a user can pause and resume processing, set the vault user account that is used to process jobs, and determine the types of jobs that the Job Processor creates and publishes.

Note: The Job Processor can be configured to launch automatically when the workstation is started in the Job Processor's Administration menu.

## Projects

# Projects

Vault projects allow you to organize and manage all project related data in one seamless interface.

## Learn About Project Features

### Links

A link is a direct representation of an object that can reside anywhere in the Project Explorer. While the link can reside in many places, the object represented by the link resides in **one place only**.

Most commands executed against a link are executed against the target object. This allows the user to perform actions on all data types from one location.

Links can be used to include data in data gathering operations like Get/Checkout, Check In, Check Out, and Reporting of a folder. To learn more, choose the link below to navigate to the Projects - Links page.

### Properties on Folders

Properties can be manually assigned to folders or automatically assigned based on the assignment of a folder category.

### Project Categories

Categories folders to create projects with the Vault. Properties associated with the categories will be applied to the project upon assignment.

### Edit Properties of Mixed Data Types

Properties can be edited on a collection of mixed data types. For example, the user could edit properties on files and items at the same time.

### Project Dashboard

Reports based on data contained within a project structure are easily run and viewable in the preview pane of the interface. The reports include files, sub-projects, items and change orders withing the project. In addition, linked data and implied data can be easily included in the report.

### User Interface

With the addition of links to the product, there are some enhancements made to the interface that make managing data simple. The Vault interface displays files, folders, and links. The links shown in the main grid can reference files, folders, items, or change orders. This allows all entity types to be managed from the main grid.

With folders in the main grid view, the user can open them and view the contents without being constrained to the tree view. Additionally, opening a linked folder will populate the data referenced by the target folder. This allows the setup and manage sub-projects.

### Create a Project in Vault

# Create a Project in Vault

Vault projects allow you to organize and manage all project related data in one seamless interface.

Follow these steps to create a project in Vault.

1. Create a new folder category that communicates the intent of your project folder. In addition, you can associate User Defined Properties with it as well.
2. Identify a location in your Vault folder structure that you would like the project to reside.
3. Create a new folder, name it, and assign it to a folder category.
4. Add new project data to the newly created project folder.
5. Use [project links](GUID-6BB2511B-FAE7-4C33-919A-E8AD09D47634.htm) to include your existing data without actually moving the files to the new folder.

Now that you've created a Vault Project, here are some simple ways you manage the project data:

* Download (link) - All project data can be downloaded with a single command. You can customize your settings to ensure that you download only the data that you need.
* Project Report (link) - Create a dashboard of your project using the fully customizable report templates.
* Property Edit (link) - Edit properties for all Project data.
* Change Lifecycle State - Manage the status and security of your project using lifecycle states.

**Parent page:** [Projects](GUID-9E079644-3086-4AB4-B97E-54316222EB12.htm)


### Project Links

# Project Links

A link allows you to organize and manage all project-related data in one location.

A link is a direct representation of an object that can reside anywhere in Project Explorer. While a link can reside anywhere in the Project Explorer, the target of the link resides in **one place only**. Links can be created for files, folders, items, and change orders.

Since a link is a direct representation of a target object, it has all of the properties of the target and will appear to be almost identical to the target. Since the link has the same name as the target, the defining difference between a link and a target is the shortcut overlay ![](../images/icon-shortcutoverlay.png) on the link's icon. For example, in the following image, the link is the child object listed.

![](../images/target-link-icons.png)

All links l have the same icon as the target with the addition of the shortcut overlay.

## How Commands Affect Links

With only two exceptions, all commands executed on a link are executed on the target object. The change made to the target object is then represented by the link. For example, when a user executes a rename command on a link to a file, the target file is renamed. The changed name is shown on the target and the link.

The two exceptions to this rule are the Delete Command and the Move command. These commands affect the link only and not the target file.

#### Include Project Links

# Include Project Links

Links can be used to include data in data gathering operations like Get/Checkout, Check In, Check Out, and Project Reporting. The Include Links command is found in the Settings dialog of the mentioned commands. The data included for each object type is described below.

![](../images/include-links-combo.png)

## Include File Links

If the selection includes a link to a file, the target file will be included in the file gathering dialog. Any relationship settings applied to the data (include dependents, include parents, etc...) dialog will be honored by the target file.

## Include Folder Links

If the selection includes a link to a folder, all contents of the target folder will be included in the file gathering dialog. The extent of data included will be consistent with how target folder data is gathered. If a link to a folder is included in the selection set then its' data as well as all of it's child folder's data will be included. Any relationship settings applied to the data (include dependents, include parents, etc...) dialog will be honored by the target file.

## Include Item Links

If the selection includes a link to an item, the primary link of the item it is assigned to will be loaded in the dialog by default. All related data retrieved for download will be determined by the primary linked file's relationships. For example, choosing to include attachments will include attachments to the file, not the item.

## Include Change Order Links

If the selection includes a link to a change order, the data gathered will be similar to that gathered by a link to a folder. Like a folder, the change order attaches to the entity master and not an iteration and the change order can contain multiple links to objects.

*File Change Order*

If the link is to a change order of a file, then the file that the change order was created from will be included in the selection set by default. Any relationship settings applied to the data will be applied to the file.

*Item Change Order*

If the link is to a change order of an item, please refer to the Include Links of Item Links above as the same data gathering rules will apply.

To learn more about the Include Links functionality please navigate to the following pages:

**Include Custom Object Links**

If the selection includes a link to a custom object instance (task, contact, etc..), the links to the custom object will be used to gather file data. Custom Objects do not contain actual files, folders, change orders, or items. Custom objects only contain links to those things as well as links to other custom objects.

Each custom object definition defined in a Vault will appear in the Include links option. Any links that the custom object contains will be followed based on the rest of the selection.

## Vault Connector

# Vault Connector

**Introduction**

The Vault Connector bridges Autodesk Vault Professional and Autodesk Fusion Manage, enabling the synchronization of Vault Items directly to a Fusion Manage workspace. **This feature is included with Vault Professional and requires an active license for Autodesk Fusion Manage to enable synchronization.** This allows for seamless data flow between engineering design data and enterprise-wide business processes.

This documentation will guide administrators through the configuration process and show users how to leverage the feature.

## Items can be synchronized in two ways:

* **On-Demand:** Users can manually push one or more Items from Vault to Fusion Manage at any time.
  + Only users with the permission "JobQueueAdd" will be able to use the **Sync to Fusion Manage** action.
  + A toast notification will appear after every sync attempt, confirming whether it was successful or unsuccessful.
* **Automated:** Synchronization can be configured to trigger automatically as part of a lifecycle state change, such as when an Item is released.

Note: For **Vault Office** users, synchronization is limited to the automated process triggered by a lifecycle state change. The on-demand "Sync to Fusion Manage" action is not available.

### **Using the Vault Connector**

Once configured, users can sync Items to Fusion Manage. The status of the synchronization is tracked using three dedicated Vault properties.

**Sync Status Properties:**

* **Fusion Manage Link State** ![](../images/Icon_FusionManageLinkStateHeader.png)
  + Up to Date: ![](../images/Icon_UpToDate.png)
  + Out of Date: ![](../images/Icon_OutOfDate.png)
* **Fusion Manage Sync Status**
  + Successful
  + Error
* **Fusion Manage Synced Date**

**Open in Fusion Manage:**

For any Item that has been successfully synchronized, users can use this command to open it directly in Fusion Manage.


## Properties

# Properties

Learn about properties in Vault.

Properties are attributes associated with a file. Vault recognizes two types of property definitions: system-defined properties and user-defined properties (UDPs). System-defined properties are those that are derived from the vault. The vault has a global set of properties that are applied to files in the vault. User-defined properties are created by using the administrative tools.

Note: Property Administration includes tasks to create and manage property definitions. You must have administrative access to perform these tasks.

Before working with properties, it is important to become familiar with the terms, data types, and attributes associated with the Vault properties system.

## Common Terms

The following table contains terms commonly used with properties.

| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Associations | Attribute that determines whether the property is associated with a file, an item, or a change order. |
| Compliant | The status of a property that meets all property policies and equivalence evaluations. |
| Data Type | The type of data accepted for the property value. This type can be text, number, boolean, or date. |
| Database Property | Any property in the database, either user defined or system. |
| Entity | An entity is the system class with which a file can be associated. Entities are files, items, or change orders. |
| Equivalent | The status of a mapped property when its value matches the source value. |
| File Property | A property associated with a file. |
| Mapped Property | A property from which the propriety being defined gets its value. For example, a UDP can get its value from several different file properties. A file property can get its value from a system property. |
| Mapping | A set of relationships between the property being defined and a property from which it receives its value. There can be multiple mappings for a given property definition. |
| Master | The property from which a mapped property gets its value. The master property writes its value to the subordinate property. |
| Non-compliant | The status of a property when it has failed to meet one or more property policies or its equivalence evaluation. |
| Non-equivalent | The status of a mapped property when its value does not match the source value. |
| Property Definition | All attributes and constraints about the property including its name, data type, initial value, mapping, minimum and maximum values, case values, in-use value, and basic search value. |
| Property Name | The name used in the GUI (graphical user interface) to identify the property. |
| Property Policy | Depending on the data type, the property policy specifies certain constraints that must be met. The constraints may include a value range, a value type, or a value format must be met. For example, a property policy might be described as follows: the property must have a value and that value must be in the range of 1 to 10. When a property fails to meet its property policies, it is considered non-compliant. |
| Property Value | The literal content of a property attribute for a specific file version. |
| Override | Determines whether the property value is over-ridden by the policy defined by its category. |
| Subordinate | The mapped property that receives its value from the master property. |
| System-Defined Property | A property in the database created by the system, which is then assigned to a file. |
| User-Defined Property (UDP) | A property in the database created by an administrator. The property can be applied to a file when it is added to a vault. |

## Data Types

Every property value has a data type that determines how that value is read and processed.

| *Data Type Name* | *Description* |
| --- | --- |
| Boolean | True or False. |
| Date Type | Can be a specific date or date range expressed by a beginning and end date. |
| Number | Numbers only. |
| Text | Letters and numbers. |

## Attributes

Properties have attributes that determine how the property is described and the constraints for its value.

| *Attribute Name* | *Description* |
| --- | --- |
| Basic Search | A constraint that determines whether or not the property should be included in basic searches. |
| Case Sensitivity | A constraint that applies to text data types. This constraint can be set to none, UPPER CASE, lower case, Name Case or Sentence case. |
| Enforce List of Values | A constraint that determines whether the property must have a value from a list. |
| Initial Value | An attribute that specifies the initial property value when one isn't specified. Note: Initial values are best used with write mappings. If an initial value is set on a regular read mapping, that read mapping has higher priority and will overwrite the initial value. The only case in which an initial value won't be overwritten by a read mapping is if the value it maps to is blank. |
| List Values | Displays the List Type dialog box from which you can enter and order values for a list. At least one item must appear in the list. |
| Minimum Length | The mininum number of characters a property value can have. |
| Maximum Length | The maximum number of characters a property value can have. |
| Requires Value | A constraint which determines whether the property must have a value to be compliant. |
| State | A setting on a property that indicates whether it recognizes the state the file in a lifecycle. |
| Usage | Indicates the number of files currently using the property. Use this information to determine which properties are used more than others, to help decide which properties can be removed from the vault. |

## Property Compliance Icons

The main view in the vault client has a Property Compliance column that lists various status icons. The Icons in this column indicate whether a property associated with the file is compliant, non-compliant, pending, or has failed the equivalence evaluation.

| *Icon* | *Value* | *Definition* |
| --- | --- | --- |
| No icon | Compliant | All properties meet policy requirements and equivalence. |
|  | Non-compliant | One or more properties do not meet property policy requirements or equivalence.  Hover your mouse over the icon to learn more about why one or more properties failed compliance. |
|  | Not calculated | There has been a change to one or more properties but equivalence and policy have not been verified yet. |
|  | Pending | Properties are currently being evaluated for equivalence. |
|  | Evaluation failed. | The equivalence evaluation failed. This is a rare situation and can result when the processor enters an evaluation loop.  Note: On the Find dialog, an evaluation failed value is added. This allows you to search for any files for which the evaluation failed. |

### Work with Properties in the Vault Client

# Work with Properties in the Vault Client

User-defined properties in a vault can be edited using the Edit Properties command.

Note: Items, Change Orders, and Custom Objects are available in Vault Professional.

## Files

Multiple files can be selected at once from the main pane to have properties edited. For example, you can select an Inventor assembly and all of its children from the Uses tab and then use the Property Editing Wizard to edit all the properties for the entire design. The selected files are copied to a temporary location on the local computer, checked out, the properties are updated, and then the files are checked back in to the vault.

For Autodesk Inventor files, including Inventor .dwg files, and Microsoft Office documents, all user-defined properties are available for editing. If a property is missing a value, you can fill it in and it will be added to the file. If the file does not contain the property as a pre-defined object, then a custom property can be created containing the value.

## Folders

Folder properties can be viewed and edited in the vault. Any User Defined Properties assigned to folder categories can be edited in the Edit Properties dialog. Select one or several folders and use the Property Edit command to modified the UDP's assigned to the folders.

## Items

The user can edit properties on multiple Items at the same time. The property edit is performed in the Edit Properties dialog instead of in an Item Edit dialog. This allows the user to select one or more than one item and edit the properties the same way they would for files.

Note: The items feature is available in Autodesk Vault Professional.

For more information, see [Edit Items](GUID-F3E9FC7B-277F-4961-8E70-5ADA7BD189C6.htm).

## Change Orders

Similar to Items, the user can select one or multiple Change Orders and edit the properties associated to Change Orders in the Edit Properties dialog.

Note: The Change Orders feature is available in Autodesk Vault Professional.

You can define properties in addition to the default properties (Change Order Number, Change Order Title, and Description, and so on). An administrator must configure additional properties before they can be used. For more information, see [Change Order - Custom Properties](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-F6B487B7-1FF7-4539-9508-0566F96DDF7B).

### Current versus historical Data shown in properties

Several properties in Vault have "(historical)" equivalent properties. If you are looking for both current and historical data based on the state of the change order, it is best to use the properties with "(historical)" in it. The properties without "(historical)" in it will show the current data of the tip version of the objects in the change order and go blank when it isn't the tip version or revision of the object.

The File Link State property represents that the change order is up to date with the latest version of the files associated with it. This information is valuable when the change order is in an Open state. The File Link State historical equivalent is not available because in order to close the item it must be up to date and linked to the latest version of the file, so the items will always be up to date.

### Properties based on object type

The properties (columns) are based on the object type. In some cases the properties are marked (Item,CO) to denote that they are unique to items and change orders.

While selecting the property, select the property type from the drop-down first so that you know what object that property column applies to.

   Note: Items, change orders, and custom objects are available in Vault Professional.

   Note: The Add or Remove Property command is only available on one entity at a time. The menu item will not be available when selecting more than one entity type in a selection. For example, if you want to add a property to both files and folders, you must do the files first and then the folders.
2. Click Actions > Add or Remove Property.
3. In the Add or Remove Property dialog box, select the property from the Property list.
4. From the Action value of the property select Add or Remove from the drop-down list.

   * **Add.** The property is added to the selected object using the default value. If the property is already assigned to the selected object, no action is taken.
   * **Remove**. The property is removed from the selected object or objects. If the property is not assigned to the selected object(s), no action is taken.

   Note: If any restrictions occur with a selected object, the property is neither added nor removed and an error message is displayed.
5. Click OK.

Note: If a property is assigned by means of a category, it cannot be removed from a file. Removing the association to the category will allow you to remove the property.

# Update Properties–Vault Add-ins

File properties can be mapped to data in Autodesk Vault. If the mapped properties are edited, the data can be updated using the Update File Properties command. This action keeps the data and assigned properties synchronized.

For more information about mapping properties, refer to [Properties Administration](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-26645DD0-AC27-4CFB-BC15-41719B5DE609) in the Administrator Tasks's section.

## AutoCAD Vault Add-in

Note: This feature available in Autodesk Vault Professional.

Use the Update Properties feature in AutoCAD or Autodesk Mechanical to keep the data and assigned properties synchronized.

The Update Properties feature is integrated with the vault revision table feature whereby it keeps revision block data synchronized with vault released information.

### Update Properties

Update properties by performing one of these procedures while working with a vaulted file:

* Click Update Properties on the Vault toolbar or Vault ribbon. In the Update Properties dialog box, all of the files that can have properties updated are listed. Turn off the check box in front of any files you do not want to update. Click OK.
* Type **vltgetlatestproperties** in the command line and press Enter. You will be prompted to enter the full Vault file name.

The Vault CAD properties that are mapped to Vault files are updated to reflect any changes made in Vault.

Note: If the mapped property with AutoCAD block attributes has noncompliant equivalence error, you need to modify the settings for the property and set the Create option to "No". Click Refresh in Vault Client to resolve the error. For more information, see [Map Properties](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-915561C8-1143-4E68-BE41-37376FA39A58).

## Inventor Vault Add-in

Autodesk Vault file properties can be mapped to CAD data in Autodesk Vault. If the mapped properties are edited, the CAD data can be updated using the Update Properties feature in Autodesk Inventor to keep the data and assigned properties synchronized.

The Update Properties feature is integrated with the vault revision table feature so that revision block data is synchronized with vault released information.

Note: It is important that you understand properties and vault revision table before doing anything with your files' properties.

### Update Properties

The Update Properties command retrieves file properties from Autodesk Vault and updates the mapped properties in the corresponding Autodesk Inventor files. Files must be checked out before getting the latest properties.

The Update Properties dialog box lists the Autodesk Inventor files that are currently checked out and can be updated.

## Vault Revision Tables (add-ins-only)

# Vault Revision Tables (add-ins-only)

Learn about using revision tables with Vault.

The Revision table is a box of information on a drawing containing key information about the drawing and where it stands in its lifecycle. A revision table typically includes the revision letter, a description of changes, the date of the last change, zonal information, and approval information. The values contained in the revision table represent the properties associated with the drawing and not the associated part/assembly or its children.

The process of manually updating the revision tables on drawings can be time-consuming, especially for changes that require simple property updates throughout the drawing's lifecycle. The Vault Revision Table feature allows you to automatically update a drawing's revision table data. Since multiple revision tables may exist in the same drawing, the Vault Revision Table feature tracks and updates all tables that begin with a named identifier.

Administrators can configure the Vault Revision Table behavior by determining the mapped values and display settings within the [Vault Revision Table Settings](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-FC3208AC-25AA-432C-A4A1-0F4A24FB5709) dialog. This dialog can also be accessed via the Behaviors tab on the Vault Settings dialog in the Autodesk Vault client.

## Supported Drawings

* AutoCAD drawings (.dwg)
* AutoCAD Mechanical drawings (.dwg)
* Autodesk Inventor drawings (.idw)

### Create a Revision Table in AutoCAD

# Create a Revision Table in AutoCAD

Use the **vltrevblock** command to create a Vault Revision Table and thereafter apply vault data to it.

The Vault Revision Table exists within AutoCAD in the form of a custom block with the name vaac\_RevBlock. Do not purge or rename the **vaac\_Revblock** block as it is referenced by both the Vault client and the AutoCAD Vault add-in for subsequent updates.

1. Type **vltrevblock** in the command line and press Enter.

   Note: The mapped fields for a Vault Revision Table on a non-vaulted drawing are displayed as empty to reflect the null state of information in the vault.
2. Click on a position in the drawing area to place the Vault Revision Table.

   Once a new Vault Revision Table is placed, all previous inserted instances will also be updated with Vault properties as defined by the administrator.

Note: Apply the Vault Revision Table to drawing templates to make deployment easy across your organization.

### Set the Location of the Revision Table Template in AutoCAD

# Set the Location of the Revision Table Template in AutoCAD

By default, the templates that determine the Vault Revision Table style, layout, and format are created in the user's application data folder. However you can refer these templates from another location within the local machine or from a shared network location.

This can be achieved by inserting a set of XML tags in the acad.exe.config file found within the AutoCAD installation directory.

## Change the location of the Vault Revision Table template for drawings in imperial units

1. Open the file acad.exe.config from the AutoCAD installation directory using an XML editor or Notepad.
2. Within the <AppSettings> tag, add the following XML tag:

   <add key="VltRevBlockImperialTemplate" value="C:\Imperial.dwg"/>

   In this instance, the Imperial.dwg file is located in the C:\ drive root directory. You may change this to a location of your choice.

## Change the location of the Vault Revision Table template for drawings in metric units

1. Open the file acad.exe.config from the AutoCAD installation directory using an XML editor or Notepad.
2. Within the <AppSettings> tag, add the following XML tag:

   <add key="VltRevBlockMetricTemplate" value="C:\Metric.dwg"/>

   In this instance, the Metric.dwg file is located in the C:\ drive root directory. You may change this to a location of your choice.

Note: The AutoCAD application must be restarted to apply any modified settings to the acad.exe.config.

## Items

# Items

Learn about using items in Vault.

Autodesk Vault Professional tracks the lifecycle of items used to manufacture products. The vault manages the files necessary to produce those items, such as CAD designs and the supporting documentation. Because information from the vault needs to be consumed by departments outside of engineering, the files in the vault are linked to items. When a file is assigned an item, a unique item number based on your company's standard is assigned to the item and a Bill of Materials is generated that tracks the relationships between associated items using the file relationship information from the vault.

## What is an item?

Items refer to what a company manages, assembles, sells, and manufactures. An item is identified by its item number or part number. Items typically represent:

* Parts
* Assemblies
* Consumable goods such as fluids, lubricants, and artwork
* Bills of Material

Items can be created in two ways:

* Assign an item to a file using the Assign Item command.
* Drag and Drop files into the Item Master tab
* Drag and Drop files into the Item Master node in the browser
* Use the New item command within the Item Master to create an item from scratch.

Note: New items tend to be user-defined items that are not included in the CAD design such as grease, adhesives, or mechanical components that are not modeled.

## What is the item master?

The Item Master is the complete list of all items within the vault. You can switch to the Item Master view by clicking the Item Master group button.

### Item Tasks

Each item in the vault has an item record. Use the Item Record dialog box to perform the following item tasks:

* View general item details
* View and edit item properties
* Change item numbers
* Change item lifecycle state or revision
* View item revision history
* View and edit BOM data
* View where used information
* View Change Orders applied to the item
* Add items to a new or existing Change Order
* Attach files and edit attachments

## Item rules

* The following files can be assigned items:

  + Inventor .ipt and .iam files checked in using the Inventor add-in.
  + AutoCAD and AutoCAD Mechanical .dwg files checked in using the add-in for AutoCAD products.
  + AutoCAD Electrical project file (wdp).

    **Note:** If you assign an item to a .dwg file that belongs to an AutoCAD Electrical project, the project file is assigned to an item, and each .dwg that belongs to that project is assigned to an item.
  + Any non-CAD files such as Microsoft Office documents.
* The files must be checked into the vault before assigning an item.
* The files must be checked in with a native application to have the BOM information for assign and update item.
* The permission assigned to a user determines the item tasks the user can perform.
* The security of an item determines which operations may be applied to an item.

## Who can work with items?

Vault Professional uses a secure database. A user must have an account to access data and must be assigned appropriate user permissions. User permissions are set using the following roles:

| Role | Description |
| --- | --- |
| *Administrator* | Full privileges within Vault Professional and administrative privileges on the server. ERP tasks are included. |
| *Item Editor Level 1* | Basic file and item privileges within Autodesk Vault Professional, but cannot delete files, folders, or items. No administrative privileges on the server. |
| *Item Editor Level 2* | Full privileges within Vault Professional, but no administrative privileges on the server. |
| *Item Reviewer* | Read-only access to items and files. |
| *Document Editor Level 1* | Basic file adding and editing privileges within the vault, but cannot delete files and folders. No administrative privileges on the server. |
| *Document Editor Level 2* | Full privileges within the vault, but no administrative privileges on the server. |
| *Document Consumer* | Read-only access to vault data only. |
| *ERP Manager* | Performs ERP tasks:   * Configure and manage the MSMQ DWF settings. * Import ERP: Import an item from an ERP system into Vault Professional. * Export ERP: Exports items for use with an ERP system. |

### Create an Item

# Create an Item

Create non-model file-based items using the New Item command.

Creating new items allows you to track items that are not modeled yet but that are required to fully describe the finished product. Items may be purchased parts, consumables (e.g., grease or fluids), documentation, or packaging. You can enter item attributes and attach files managed by the vault to the new item. Items can be added to the BOM of another item using the BOM editing functionality.

User-defined items can be designated as one of the following:

* **Assembly:** the item represents a group of designs. For example, to create a group of parts, such as a repair kit that is shipped with a product.
* **Document:** the item represents information that needs to be tracked, such as a design specification or set of instructions.
* **Electrical:** item represents a component of an AutoCAD Electrical project.
* **Electrical Project:** item represents an AutoCAD Electrical project.
* **General:** an item type that does not meet another classification.
* **Part:** item represents a part without an associated CAD file. Select when creating non-modeled parts.
* **Process:** item represents a process, such as heat treatment where an attached file has the specification.
* **Product:** item represents an entire product.
* **Purchased:** item represents a part to be purchased

Note: Custom item categories that are created using the Item Categories dialog are also available in the list.

An item number based on the default item number format is generated. The item number can be edited after the item has been created in the item master.

## Create a New Item

1. Select the Item Master view.
2. Click New on the tool bar.

   If the administrator has granted you permission to assign item categories, select a category and click OK to continue to the new item record.

   The default item category is Document. To change the item category, click the drop-down arrow and select a new category.
3. In the Item Title text box, enter an item title.
4. In the Item Description text box, enter a brief description of the item.
5. From the Units drop-down list, select the default units for the item.
6. To attach files in the vault to the item, select the Actions menu > Attachments. The files attached to the item are displayed in the Associated Files list. Click attach and browse to the file that you want to associate with the item.

   Item properties and BOM data is extracted from the file and the item record is updated with the new data.

   If Assign Items to Children is turned on, items are automatically created for children files.

   Note: No items are created for file components. These components are added to the BOM as excluded and unassigned rows.
7. To link a file to the item, perform one of the following actions:

   * Right-click in the Associated Files box and select Add Link. Browse to the files that you want to link to the item and click Open.
   * Drag-and-drop files into the Associated Files field.
   * Copy a file from the vault and paste it into the Associated Files field.

   The first file added in the Associated Files field will be the primary link to the item. Additional files are secondary links. If multiple files are added at the same time, a random file is selected as a primary link. If a primary link already exists, all additional files become secondary links.

   Note: **AutoCAD Mechanical Users** – If the AutoCAD Mechanical file has no top-level assembly or has more than one component, the file is attached to the item instead of linked to the item. If the file has a top-level assembly, the assembly becomes the primary link to the item. If the file has no assembly but has only one component, the component becomes the primary link.
8. Right-click in the Properties list and elect Modify Attached Properties to attach properties to the new item.

   Note: If you recently saved the item record, you must click Edit to continue making modifications to the record.
9. Click Save to save your changes.

   If desired, proceed to the other item record tabs to add comments, turn on items in the bill of materials, or add the item to a change order.
10. When finished, click Save and Close.
11. If you want to keep the record open but want to be able to edit other items, click Exit Edit Mode.

### Write Back Item Properties to a File

# Write Back Item Properties to a File

You can manually synchronize properties on files associated with items.

By default, item properties are written back to the associated file from Vault add-ins, Vault Explorer, and the Job Processor.

Item properties take precedence over file properties and file mappings. If the file's properties are edited and properties are synchronized, the item properties will overwrite the file properties.

Note: Editing and saving a property may also result in an item property being written back to a File.

Important: The **Write Item properties back to the file** check box on the [Items tab](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-A88D9FBD-AF27-481A-AFEC-E5EACD6BB04E) must be selected for item properties to be written back to a file.

### Assign Item Numbers

# Assign Item Numbers

When an item is created, an item number is automatically applied based on the [default numbering scheme](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-F5356B61-194B-45BF-8B92-31C299A37206). However, if the numbering scheme requires user input, the Item Number dialog opens so you can enter the required values.

1. If you do not want to use the default numbering scheme, select a new numbering scheme from the scheme drop-down list. Otherwise, continue onto the next step.
2. If user input is required for the item numbering assignment, select a field and enter the required value.

   You can also click Replace to search for the property that you want to use in the field.
3. Click PreCheck to verify that all values are accepted. Make any changes, if necessary.

### Change Item Numbers

# Change Item Numbers

Learn about changing item numbers.

The term item refers to what a company manages, assembles, sells and manufactures. An item is identified by its item number and is often referred to as the part number.

The following commands generate an item number:

* New Item
* Assign Item

The Assign Item and New Item commands create item numbers based on the default scheme specified in the Administrator dialog box.

Note: Default numbering schemes that require user input are not applied automatically. Instead an auto-generated number is assigned. You must edit an item number requiring user input and select the default item numbering scheme. All fields must be filled in.

Fields that require user input display a question mark (?) in the Edit Item Number dialog box.

An item number cannot be opened for editing if the item is being edited by another user. You must have administrator rights to edit an item number.

## Change Item Numbers

Note: New item numbering schemes can be defined in the Administration dialog box. Available schemes are listed in the Change Item Number dialog box.

1. Right-click on one or more items in the Item Master or BOM view and select Change Item Number.
2. Select a numbering scheme from the drop-down list.

   * **Use Property Mapping** - Uses mapped properties to generate the item number. By default, property mapping is always chosen first. Even if a different scheme is set as default, property mappings take priority over other schemes.
   * **Sequential** - Numbers are generated sequentially. This scheme is used if no property mappings are available.
   * **Mapped** - Numbers are generated based on user input.

   Fields that require user input display the default values. Auto-generated fields are represented as a pound sign (#).
3. Enter text as needed in the event a field requires user input.
4. Click Precheck to verify the new item number. Make any changes if necessary.
5. If more than one item is in the list and you want to remove one, select the item and click Remove.
6. Click OK to accept the new item number.

### Assign Items

# Assign Items

CAD data becomes available to the non-CAD user by assigning an item to a file. Assigning an item requires Item Create permission.

Assigning an item to a file within a vault creates an item record in the Item Master and allows the CAD data to be tracked throughout its lifecycle.

## Files that can be assigned items

* Autodesk Inventor IPT, IAM, IPN, DWG, and IDW files that have been checked into the vault using the Inventor add-in

  **Note:** You cannot assign an item to an iAssembly or iPart factory.
* AutoCAD and AutoCAD Mechanical DWG files
* AutoCAD Electrical projects
* Non-CAD files such as Microsoft Office documents

When an item is assigned to an Autodesk Inventor .ipt or .iam file, the related 2D .idw files are automatically associated to the item.

Note: Only design representation files (.pdf, .dxf, .step) created through standard Vault workflows such as Job Processor tasks or the Vault Client '[Create File from CAD Files](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-EE6877E0-BBEB-4FB2-8B08-F9052F6FCB32)' operation are automatically associated with items. Files that are manually attached, even if recategorized as Design Representation, are not automatically associated during Assign/Update Item operations.

The associated .idw files are listed in the item's Associated Files list and are available for mark up within the item. When an .iam file is assigned an item, the presentation file, .ipn, is also associated with the item and displayed in the Associated Files list.

When you assign an item to a file, an item number is automatically generated based on property mapping. You can apply a different item numbering scheme other than the default item number by editing the item record.

## Assign an Item

1. Right-click one or more files in the main view and select Assign/Update Item.

   A new item is created for each of the files selected and for the related files.
2. If you assign an item to a single file, the item record automatically opens for editing. Begin making changes, if needed.
3. If you select multiple files and assign an item, an item icon displays in the Item Column. However, you must right-click on a file and select Open Item to view the item record. Select Edit on the item record toolbar to begin editing.

   Note: Item Numbering is automatically applied based on the [default numbering scheme](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-F5356B61-194B-45BF-8B92-31C299A37206). However, if the numbering scheme requires user input, the Item Number dialog opens. Enter the required values and click OK to continue.

   See [Edit an Item](GUID-CB764599-B7C9-4DE2-A445-A7B02CE8EB57.htm) for information on modifying an item record, including changing the item number, adding and removing rows to the BOM, adding items to a change order, and attaching files.
4. Click Save and Close when you are finished.

   The item master is updated with the new items. If items were assigned to Autodesk Inventor assembly files, any associated drawing (.idw) and presentation (.ipn) files are linked to the items. If items were assigned to Inventor part files, the associated drawing (.idw) files are linked to the items.

Note: Links to design representation files (.pdf, .dxf, .step) are automatically removed when their source files are removed from the item. During the next Assign/Update Item operation, any remaining design representation files in Vault will be automatically re-associated with the item.

### Update an Item

# Update an Item

Update synchronizes items with the properties of the associated file versions in the vault. An item can be updated even if the associated file has not been changed so as to update any properties that have been globally added since the last update.

Updating an item linked to an assembly file creates a new item for each new file associated with it. If any drawing files that were originally associated with the CAD files are removed, their association with the item is also removed when the item is updated.

**Rules for Updating an Item**

* If the item has child items (for example, an Autodesk Inventor assembly), the child items are also updated to reflect the most recent versions of the child files.
* Attached files that are pinned are not updated.
* Before updating items, make sure drawings are up to date with the model so that they are linked to the item.

## Update an Item

* Right-click on an item in the item master and select Update.

  The Update Item dialog displays progress for the update process.

  If the item is up to date, a message displays showing that no changes were made.

  If the item was updated with new information from associated files, then the item record opens with the updated data.

Note: The following icons indicate the state of a primary or secondary item:

* ![](../images/icon-item-file-link.png) - item is up to date
* ![](../images/icon-file-item-link-outofsate.png) - item needs to be updated

### Assign a File to an Item

# Assign a File to an Item

By assigning a file to an item, the item can represent the file in a BOM. You can assign files to new or existing items.

1. Right-click on the file that you want to assign to an item and select Assign To.

   Tip: You can also drag and drop a file onto an existing item in the Item Master or onto the Item node to create a new item for it.

   The Item dialog opens in edit mode. If the item was created for the file, the file becomes the primary associated file.
2. Make any [changes](GUID-CB764599-B7C9-4DE2-A445-A7B02CE8EB57.htm) you want to the item record and click Save to save your changes.

**Parent page:** [Items](GUID-F3E9FC7B-277F-4961-8E70-5ADA7BD189C6.htm)


### Add an Item to a Change Order

# Add an Item to a Change Order

Items can be added to change orders from the main item grid, the item BOM tab, and the Where Used tab.

1. Right-click on an item or items in the Item Master that are not already assigned to a change order and select Add to Change Order.

   Note: You can also select Actions > Add to Change Order in the item record.
2. Select whether you want to add the item(s) to a new change order or an existing change order.

   If you select an existing change order, the Find dialog opens. Search for the change order to which you want to assign the item(s) and select a change order from the results list. Click OK to complete the assignment.

   If you select a new change order, [fill in the change order](GUID-967A669D-028F-4E7B-AD66-86780FDAC4E9.htm) and click Save to complete the assignment.

### Attach a File to an Item

# Attach a File to an Item

Use Attachments to attach any file type from the vault to an item. For example, you can attach assembly instructions to an assembly or a drawing to a purchased part.

Note: Auxiliary files attached to a primary file in the vault do not get automatically attached to the item .

Pinning an attached file prevents the file from being updated. An attached file that is not pinned updates to the most recent version each time the item is updated.

When the Number of Attachments column is displayed in the Item Master the paper clip icon displays for every item with one or more attachment. Control-click the paper clip to view attached files.

## Manage File Attachments

1. Right-click on an item and select Attachments.

   The current Attachments for the item are displayed.
2. To attach files, click Attach and browse to the location of the file or click Search to find files in the vault. See [Select File from Vault](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-A55AD9BD-1801-4BD8-8A36-C096F85018C4) for more information.

   Select one or more files and click Open.

   The most recent version of the attached file is displayed in the Attachments dialog box.
3. Modify the way an Item Update operates on the attached files.

   By default, attached files update to the most recent version each time the item is updated. You can pin a particular version of the file to the item so that it references that version instead of the newest version during item updates.

   1. Select the Version Number field and select the version of the file you want to pin from the drop-down list.
   2. Select the Pin check box to pin the file to the specified version.

   During an update, the file version specified at the time of attachment remains attached to the item and the item is updated with the most current information from that file version.
4. To detach a file, select the file, and click Detach.
5. Click OK to save your changes and close the dialog.

### Item File Links

# Item File Links

When files are assigned to Items, they are given specific Item File Link types. The Item File Link type defines how the Item relates to the linked file.

Note: Item File Links are not the same as attaching a file to an item. For more information regarding attaching files to items please see [Attach a File to an Item](GUID-869F7592-D61A-41FF-B2B1-D377FFAF61AE.htm).

After a link has been created you can modify the link type or remove the link. Removing the link will disassociate the file from the Item.

## Component and Subcomponent Links

For linking purposes, parts are considered a component or subcomponent, depending on how they are defined.

* Components are parts that are defined by a unique file.
* Subcomponents are parts which are defined internally as part of a file. For example, subcomponents can be virtual components in Inventor, or part references and structured components in AutoCAD Mechanical. Subcomponents are often defined multiple times in many different files and assemblies.

  A subcomponent link is established when a part (component) is defined within a file, but it is not the component defined by the file.

  Note: Administrators can configure Vault to create standard component links instead of primary and secondary subcomponent links during an Item Assign or Item Update event. See [Configure Item Assignment](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-FF26CEE9-A2B7-47BB-9FFF-1655D0A5C91B) for more information.

### Primary and Secondary Subcomponent Link Rules

Primary and secondary subcomponent links adhere to these rules when set as [the preferred link types](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-FF26CEE9-A2B7-47BB-9FFF-1655D0A5C91B#GUID-FF26CEE9-A2B7-47BB-9FFF-1655D0A5C91B__LI_00EFC620783344E09414BE824C8540B9) for an Item Assign or Item Update event.

* If a file is assigned to an item, and a subcomponent is found for which there is no existing Item, then a Primary Subcomponent link is assigned to the file. If a pre-existing item is found, then a Secondary Subcomponent link is assigned.
* If a Primary Subcomponent is later defined in its own file, then a Primary link is assigned to the new file and the Primary Subcomponent link automatically changes to a Secondary Subcomponent link.

### Subcomponent Link Examples

* **AutoCAD Mechanical** - If a whole assembly is drawn and defined in one file, the assembly receives a primary link to an item because the file is the definition of the assembly. All subassemblies and parts in the assembly receive subcomponent links from the assembly file to items.
* **Inventor** - Use subcomponents as virtual parts. For example, a user may add a virtual part for grease to their assembly. There is no physical part file modeled for grease, so it is solely defined within the assembly. That virtual grease component receives a subcomponent from the assembly file to an item.

## Item File Link Types

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *Primary* |  | A component with a primary link is the primary definition for the Item. Properties are read from this component on Item assign and update. Properties can be written back to the component as well. When the Item is released the primary link file will be locked.  By default, a state change cannot be executed if the link needs updating. This setting can be configured in the state transition. |
| *Secondary* |  | A component with a secondary link is a secondary or duplicate definition for the Item. Properties are not read from this component on Item updates, though properties can be written back to the component. When the Item is released the secondary link component is locked.  By default, a state change cannot be executed if the link needs updating. This setting can be configured in the state transition. |
| *Primary Subcomponent* |  | A component containing the primary definition for a subcomponent. Properties are read from and can be written back this component. When the Item is released, the component is locked.  By default, a state change cannot be executed if the link needs updating. This setting can be configured in the state transition. |
| *Secondary Subcomponent* |  | A component containing a secondary or duplicate definition for a subcomponent. Properties are not read from this component, though properties can be written back to the component. When the Item is released, the component is locked.  By default, a state change cannot be executed if the link needs updating. This setting can be configured in the state transition. |
| *Standard Component* |  | A component with a Standard Component link contains standard content. Properties are read for the Standard Component only at Item assign, and properties are written back to the file. When the Item is released, the file is locked.  Subcomponents also receive Standard Component links. |
| *Tertiary* |  | A file with a tertiary link is a design document file such as an .idw, .ipn, or .dwg file. These links are automatically assigned when the corresponding model file is assigned to Item. Files with Tertiary links are locked when the Item is released. |

### Roll Back the Lifecycle State of an Item

# Roll Back the Lifecycle State of an Item

Return an item to a previous lifecycle state with the Roll Back Lifecycle State Change command.

Note: This feature is available in Vault Professional.

When an item is rolled back, it:

* returns to the item version associated with the rolled-back state.
* returns to the security, lifecycle definition, and revisions scheme associated with the rolled-back state.
* retains any property definitions associated with the current version being rolled back.

The current version of the item is deleted when the item is rolled back to a previous state.

## Rules for Rolling Back an Item Lifecycle State

You can roll back an item from any state to another state as long as:

* The rolled back state has not been deleted.
* The current lifecycle state is not  and the rolled back state is not .
* The rolled back state is not controlled by [purge](GUID-986334F8-B790-4BA2-A445-E4AE3D02B17C.htm) settings.
* There are no ECO restrictions on state change.
* The rolled back state did not exist before the ECO was created.
* The ECO is not closed.

  Note: If the ECO was canceled, you can still roll back to the last state in the ECO.
* There are no component link restrictions.

  For example, if rolling back to the previous state would link the item to a component that is only allowed one link and the component is already linked to another item, then the roll back is not permitted.

Only users with Item Editor Level 2, ERP Manager, or Administrator roles can change the state on an item.

## Roll Back the Lifecycle State of an Item

1. Select an item in the Item Master, and then select Actions > Roll Back Lifecycle State Change.
2. Click Continue to complete the lifecycle state rollback.

### Purge Items from the Vault Client

# Purge Items from the Vault Client

Purge item versions in a vault based on the item's lifecycle state control settings.

Note: Items are available in Vault Professional.

When a lifecycle state is created, the administrator must identify which item and file versions in that state are retained during a purge.

For example, a lifecycle state can be defined so that all items in the Review State are purged except for the latest version when the Purge command is invoked.

Note: Item versions are purged based on their [lifecycle control settings](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-02294D64-9ACA-4546-956E-095D9D7814B1). You can't purge any item version if an item does not have a lifecycle assignment.

You can purge items from the ADMS Console or the Autodesk Vault Client.

## Purge Items from the Autodesk Vault Client

1. In the Vault Client, select the items for which you want to purge versions.
2. Select Actions > Purge Items.
3. Click OK to confirm the purge.

Item versions are purged based on their lifecycle control settings.

The Purge Item Result dialog displays to show details of the purge. Click Close when finished reviewing the purge results.

**Parent page:** [Items](GUID-F3E9FC7B-277F-4961-8E70-5ADA7BD189C6.htm)


### Purge Items Summary

# Purge Items Summary

Review the details of a purge on the Purge Item Result dialog.

Note: Items are available in Vault Professional.

After you [Purge Items](GUID-986334F8-B790-4BA2-A445-E4AE3D02B17C.htm) with the Vault Client, the Purge Item Result dialog displays. This dialog shows the item numbers for all items that were selected for purge, and the number of versions of each item that were successfully purged.

If an item had no versions that met the purge criteria defined in the [lifecycle control settings](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-02294D64-9ACA-4546-956E-095D9D7814B1), or if the item is not assigned to a lifecycle, a status of *no purgeable versions* is displayed.

### Sync Items to Fusion Manage

# Sync Items to Fusion Manage

The Vault Connector allows users to synchronize Vault Items and their associated data directly to a Fusion Manage workspace. This can be done on-demand from the Vault client or automatically as part of a lifecycle state change.

## Prerequisites for Syncing

Before you can use the `Sync to Fusion Manage` or `Open in Fusion Manage` commands, the following conditions must be met:

* The Vault Connector must be enabled in the ADMS Console.
* Property mappings must be configured between Vault and the target Fusion Manage workspace.

## The Synchronization Process

When an Item is synced from Vault to Fusion Manage, the connector performs the following actions in sequence:

1. Creates a corresponding item in the target Fusion Manage workspace.
2. Populates the item's Bill of Materials (BOM) based on the Vault Item's BOM.
3. Uploads and attaches relevant files to the Fusion Manage item.

## Synced Attachments

The synchronization process includes the following types of attachments from the Vault Item:

* Direct attachments (excluding design files).
* DWF attachments from primary and tertiary linked files.
* Design representation attachments (such as PDF or STEP files) from primary and tertiary linked files.

## Important Considerations

* **Item Revisions:** The Vault Connector synchronizes Item data but does not sync the Item's revision history. Each sync updates the existing record in Fusion Manage to match the current version in Vault.
* **Open in Fusion Manage:** The `Open in Fusion Manage` command is only available for Items that have been successfully synchronized at least once.

**Parent page:** [Items](GUID-F3E9FC7B-277F-4961-8E70-5ADA7BD189C6.htm)


## Bills of Materials (BOMs)

# Bills of Materials (BOMs)

A Bill of Materials (BOM) is a summary of items needed to manufacture a part or product.

Note: The BOM feature is available only in Vault Professional.

A BOM includes item numbers, quantities, part descriptions, lifecycle state, and other properties.

Every time a file with a BOM is assigned an item, a BOM is generated in Vault for that item. BOM details differ depending on what the item represents.

* An item representing a single part typically contains BOM information related only to that part.
* An item representing an assembly typically contains BOM information for all parts in the assembly.
* An item representing an assembly comprised of subassemblies and parts typically contains BOM information for all of the subassemblies.

## What Can I Do with BOMs?

BOMs are a powerful tool for tracking a product because you can:

* Update them when items are added and removed from the design.
* Add custom items that are outside the design process, such as grease or adhesives.
* Compare one BOM revision with another to see what has changed between revisions. For example, you can pinpoint exactly which parts changed between revisions of an assembly.
* Manually create a BOM by creating an item from scratch, and then adding items to the new item's BOM.
* Save BOM View as a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet or a comma-separated values file (.csv) so it can be analyzed or formatted in other applications for custom reports and printouts.

### BOM Rules

* Items that have never been released are displayed in their current state.
* If an item has been released, then the released revision is listed, even if it has been changed back to work-in-progress (WIP).
* When a part that is used in multiple assemblies is released, the new released revision of the part immediately appears in the BOM of every assembly in which it is used.

## Important BOM Terminology

Knowing these terms and phrases will make understanding the help and BOM workflows easier.

### Add a Row to a BOM

# Add a Row to a BOM

By adding rows to an existing BOM, you can add non-CAD items such as grease or adhesives. You can also account for items that are not part of the design but are required for manufacturing and shipment, such as packaging.

You can create a BOM from scratch by [creating a new item](GUID-925F1AFF-B211-435E-A9CB-4F2FD951C482.htm) and building its BOM row by row without ever creating a single CAD file.

Note: When manually adding items to a BOM, remember to enter a quantity for the new item since there may be no CAD data to determine the quantity automatically.

When you add a new row to a BOM, you can choose to link it to an existing item or a new item. New items are not assigned unless you manually assign them.

## Add a Row to a BOM

1. In the item master, double-click an item to open the item record.
2. Select the Bill of Materials tab.

   Note: Rows can only be added to the BOM when it is in multi-level view.
3. Click Edit on the item record toolbar to put the item record in edit mode.
4. Right-click a row in the BOM and select Add New Row from the context menu.
5. Choose whether you want to add an existing item or a new item.

   If you choose a new item, the item is added immediately to the BOM. Be sure to fill out the details when you're finished adding rows to the BOM. See [Create an Item](GUID-925F1AFF-B211-435E-A9CB-4F2FD951C482.htm) for more information.

   If you choose existing item, use the Find dialog to locate the item or items to add to the bill of materials. From the search results list, select the items to add and then click OK. The items are added to the BOM and automatically turned on.
6. Click Save on the item record to save your changes.

**Parent page:** [Bills of Materials (BOMs)](GUID-86373139-0500-4B28-A5C3-DE80A53D1AF6.htm)


### Remove a Row from a BOM

# Remove a Row from a BOM

Remove rows from the BOM that are no longer needed.

For example, you might need to remove individual parts because you track and buy the assembly as a single item.

Note: If you wish to track an item or virtual component but don't want it represented as part of the BOM, you can simply [turn the row off](GUID-7FEA3BEB-09DE-4225-9C59-798D4A7FD5C6.htm) instead of removing the row altogether. For example, an assembly might exist in the CAD file for reference only, but should not be represented as part of the BOM. In these instances you can keep the item listed but turn off the row.

Items listed in the BOM can be removed by deleting the rows containing the items. When a row is removed from the BOM, the link to the item and links to all children of the item are removed. Removing a row for an assembly in the BOM removes the assembly row and all corresponding child rows.

## Remove a Row from a BOM

1. In the item master, double-click an item.
2. In the item record, select the Bill of Materials tab.

   Note: The BOM can only be edited when it is in the multi-level view.
3. Click Edit on the toolbar to put the item record in edit mode.
4. Right-click on a row in the BOM and select Remove Row.

   The link to the item and links to all children of the item are removed.

**Parent page:** [Bills of Materials (BOMs)](GUID-86373139-0500-4B28-A5C3-DE80A53D1AF6.htm)


### Turn BOM Rows on and Off

# Turn BOM Rows on and Off

Turn off BOM rows that you do not want included in the BOM process but still want listed on the BOM.

By adding rows to an existing BOM, you can add non-CAD items such as grease or adhesives. You can also account for items that are not part of the design but are required for manufacturing and shipment, such as packaging.

In addition, you can also add virtual components now and not assign an item until the component is ready. This flexibility allows you to build the BOM piece by piece, even if parts of the design have not been created yet, making it easier to track the entire project before everything is ready. Virtual components that do not have an item assignment or items that you do not want included in the BOM can be turned off.

## Turn a BOM Row On

Turn on rows to include them in the BOM.

Note: If a row is turned off and does not have an item assigned to it, an item is automatically created when the row is turned on.

1. Double-click on an item in the Item Master to open the item record.
2. Select the Bill of Materials tab.
3. Click Edit on the item record toolbar to put the item record in edit mode.
4. Right-click on the row that you want to turn on and select Turn row on.

   Note: You can also click the On/Off ![](../images/icon-rowturnedoff.png) icon to turn a row on.

   The item is now included in the BOM.

## Turn a BOM Branch On

Turn on multiple rows in a branch at the same time with the Turn Branch On command.

1. Double-click on an item in the Item Master to open the item record.
2. Select the Bill of Materials tab.
3. Click Edit on the item record toolbar to put the item record in edit mode.
4. Right-click on the row for which you want to turn on as well as all of its children and select Turn Branch On.

The selected row and all of its children are included in the BOM.

## Turn a BOM Row Off

Turn rows off to exclude them from the BOM. These rows are also excluded from the Item Export process.

1. Double-click on an item in the Item Master to open the item record.
2. Select the Bill of Materials tab.
3. Click Edit on the item record toolbar to put the item record in edit mode.
4. Right-click on the row that you want to turn off and select Turn row off.

The item is now excluded from the BOM.

### Grouped BOM Rows

# Grouped BOM Rows

Learn about grouped BOM rows.

A grouped BOM row is a row that contains multiple occurrences of an item that share a single parent, but have one or more BOM row properties with different values. The different values for the BOM row properties can include, but are not limited to, Length, Quantity, and Description.

A grouped BOM row is indicated in the BOM by the Grouped ![](../images/icon-bom-merged.png) [icon](Bill-of-Materials-BOM-Status.htm).

![](../images/screenshot-ve-bom-groupedrows.jpg)

## Why Are Some BOM Rows Grouped?

Frequently, objects in a design come from the same stock pieces, but have different properties. For example, stock material that is cut to length or has different finishes.

These components will often have the same part number, with other properties indicating how the component differs from the original.

Because these components have the same part number, they are often combined in the CAD BOM. When that CAD BOM is imported into a vault, these grouped rows are kept in tact unless the administrator has elected not to [group BOM rows as per the design BOM](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-FF26CEE9-A2B7-47BB-9FFF-1655D0A5C91B#GUID-FF26CEE9-A2B7-47BB-9FFF-1655D0A5C91B__LI_73F596D76A6E4A76A7BF667E1FE0B4C6).

Note: Group BOM rows as per the design BOM must be enabled on the [Configure Assign Item dialog](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-FF26CEE9-A2B7-47BB-9FFF-1655D0A5C91B) for Vault retain grouped rows based on CAD BOM data. If this option is not enabled, the rows are displayed individually.

## Rules for Grouping BOM Rows

The following rules must be met for BOM rows to be grouped in Vault.

* Auto-select first duplicate must be enabled on the Configure Assign Item dialog to enable the Group BOM Rows feature.
* BOM rows must be imported from a the CAD BOM to be grouped. BOM rows created manually are not grouped automatically even though there may be items with the same number.
* The **Group BOM rows as per the design BOM** option on the Configure Assign Item dialog must be enabled if you want to retain CAD BOM groups after import.
* Item numbers must match.
* Item occurrences must share a single parent.
* Items in a grouped row must be of a unit of measure that's in the same family so they can be merged.

  For example, rows using both inches and millimeters as units of measure can be merged, but rows using mass and length cannot be merged.
* A group's on/off setting persists when the group is unmerged. For example, if a group BOM row is set to OFF and the group is unmerged so that all BOM rows are listed individually, all of the unmerged rows retain the OFF setting.

## How Does Vault Display Grouped BOM Row Values?

When BOM rows are grouped together, only one row is displayed in the BOM. Unless otherwise specified, the values that are displayed represent the primary BOM row's properties.

**Details**

* The Primary BOM row is the row with the Detail ID. If none of the rows in the group has a Detail ID, then another row is chosen as the primary row.
* **Position–**This is the position of the group itself. If the rows are ungrouped, this value applies to all of the rows.
* **Row Order–**This is the row order of the group itself. If the rows are ungrouped, this value applies to all of the rows.
* **Unit Qty–**If the items in a BOM row group all share the same Unit of Measure type but the actual units are different, the value of the primary row is displayed in the Unit QTY field.

  Note: The Units QTY field is not displayed by default. You can add it to your BOMs by [Customizing the BOM View](GUID-E926FCEE-9774-4329-BDCD-87BB537BFE17.htm).
* **Item QTY–**The Item QTY value is the number of items in the group.

  Note: The Item QTY field is not displayed by default. You can add it to your BOMs by [Customizing the BOM View](GUID-E926FCEE-9774-4329-BDCD-87BB537BFE17.htm).
* **Quantity–**The Quantity value is the sum of all quantities in the group.

### Reordering Rows in a BOM

# Reordering Rows in a BOM

The order of items in the Bill of Materials is inherited from the CAD application that generated the BOM. This order can be modified.

When viewing the BOM in Vault Professional, the Row Order column indicates the order of the items. Each subassembly listed in the BOM displays its own numbering scheme, starting at 1. The parent rows increment by one and the children rows increment by tenths. For example, if a parent row is 4, then the first child starts with 4.1.

New items added to the BOM within Vault Professional are appended to the end of the order. New items added to the BOM from a CAD add-in are appended to the end of the order when an update is performed.

When an item is removed from the BOM, a gap occurs in the numbering sequence. To update the order, drag-and-drop rows to reset the numbers. Only the top-level children in an item's BOM can be renumbered.

Items listed in the BOM can be reordered by dragging and dropping items within the BOM. The items can be returned to the last saved order by clicking Restore to Saved Order ![](../images/icon-restoresavedorder.png) on the toolbar.

## Reorder a BOM

1. In the item master, double-click an item.
2. In the item record, click Edit and select the Bill of Materials tab.
3. Click on the Row Order column to sort by the current order.

   Note: The BOM must be sorted by the Row Order column to reorder rows.
4. Select a row and drag and drop it to the new location.

   Note: Rows can be dragged and dropped within the current parent. They cannot be dragged outside of the parent.
5. To revert back to the last saved order, click Restore Saved Order ![](../images/icon-restoresavedorder.png) on the toolbar.
6. To manually modify a row value, click within the Row Order cell and change the value.

   Note: When editing the row values, only the child's value is shown and not the parent's. So if you edit a child file that is 4.2 in the row order, only the 2 shows.
7. Click Save to save the changed order or click File > Exit to close the item record without saving the new BOM order.

### Change the Position of an Item in a BOM

# Change the Position of an Item in a BOM

Each item has a position number in the Bill of Materials. This position number is a property that can be modified by the user.

## Rules for Position Numbers

* The BOM can only be edited when it is in multi-level view.
* Position numbers are alphanumeric.
* If the BOM row was manually or automatically created, the position can be manually modified.
* The position value is sticky for manually created rows.
* If the BOM row was imported from CAD, the position may be overwritten if the values change on the CAD side.

  Important: It is not transparent if the row was manually created or imported from CAD. Modify positions with caution.
* Duplicate position numbers are highlighted in yellow, similar to Inventor.

## Modify an item position number in a BOM

1. In the item master, double-click an item.
2. In the item record, click Edit and select the Bill of Materials tab.
3. Select a row in the BOM.
4. Click the position for the row.
5. Enter an alphanumeric string for the new position.
6. Press Enter.
7. Save the BOM to record your changes.

**Parent page:** [Bills of Materials (BOMs)](GUID-86373139-0500-4B28-A5C3-DE80A53D1AF6.htm)


### Change the Quantity of an Item in a BOM

# Change the Quantity of an Item in a BOM

The quantity of any item can be changed in the BOM.

For example, you can change the quantity of items that were added to the BOM from scratch or of parts that are modeled once but are reused throughout the design, such as bolts. When adding non-CAD items to a BOM, you must include a quantity because there is no CAD data to determine the quantity automatically. Item quantity can only be edited on the Bill of Materials tab in an item record.

The BOM can only be edited when it is in multi-level view. Quantities can only be edited for the direct children of the host item. To edit a quantity within a subassembly listed in the BOM, open the subassembly from the item master.

The item quantity can be either static or calculated. A calculated quantity is derived from the source CAD file and updates accordingly. A static quantity overrides the quantity specified in the linked CAD file and the original quantity contained in the CAD design is no longer reflected in the BOM.

A different font is used to identify whether a quantity is static or calculated.

| Type | Font |
| --- | --- |
| Static | *Italic* |
| Calculated | Standard |

## Change the Quantity of an Item

1. In the item master, double-click an item.
2. In the item record, click Edit and select the Bill of Materials tab.
3. Select a row in the BOM.
4. Click the quantity for the row.
5. Enter a number for the quantity.
6. Press Enter.

Note: When you change the quantity of an item, you override the quantity derived from the linked CAD file by default. The original quantity contained in the CAD design is no longer reflected in the BOM.

## Override the Current Quantity

* Right-click the quantity and then select Static Quantity.

The quantity no longer reflects the value in the linked CAD file and does not update when the quantity is changed in the source file.

## Revert the Quantity to the CAD Value

* Right-click the quantity and select Calculated Quantity.

The quantity will reflect the value in the linked CAD file after the item is updated.

### Bill of Materials - Autodesk Inventor and Manufacturing

# Bill of Materials - Autodesk Inventor and Manufacturing

You can use Autodesk Inventor to manage the BOM in Vault Professional.

In an Autodesk Inventor assembly file, you can assign a BOM status for each component within the file. The status you assign determines whether the component displays in an Item in Vault Professional. In Autodesk Inventor, in the BOM dialog box, a component can be assigned one of the following:

* **Normal:** treats an item as component in the BOM and can be assigned quantities.
* **Phantom:** indicates the component is used to simplify the design process and only exists temporarily. They exist in the design, but are not distinct line items in a bill of materials. These do not appear in Vault Professional when an assembly is assigned an item.
* **Reference:** indicates the component is used as construction geometry or to add context to a design, such as a skeleton part or assembly for skeleton modeling. These do not appear in Vault Professional when an assembly is assigned an item.
* **Purchased:** indicates the component is not fabricated, such as Cylinders, pistons, or shock absorbers. Purchased components are considered a single BOM line item, regardless if it is a part or an assembly. For example, an assembly marked as purchased is listed as a part in parts-only parts list. If the purchased component is an assembly, its children are not generally included in the BOM. Children are also excluded from quantity calculations in the BOM. Normal child components of a purchased assembly are included in structured parts lists, and numbered, but are hidden in parts-only parts lists.
* **Inseparable:** indicates a fabricated assembly whose child components are maintained as a single item.

For detailed information on these different categories, see the Help in Autodesk Inventor.

### Create BOM Report

# Create BOM Report

Create BOM reports that show Parts-level, First-level, and Multi-level views.

Note: Structure is not shown in BOM reports. For this reason, the BOM row order is significant for Multi-level BOM reports. The row order can be leveraged to show the level of the BOM.

Vault comes with three out-of-the-box BOM templates that can be used to create BOM Reports:

* BOM - First-Level.rdlc
* BOM - Multi-Level.rdlc
* BOM - Parts-Only.rdlc

Note: The BOM Report templates are located at C:\Program Files\Autodesk\Vault [*Edition*] [*year*]\Explorer\Report Templates. See [Create Report Templates](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-6D1DF94C-7498-4836-9CA8-FFFB25C002EA) for more information about designing your own template.

## Create a BOM Report

1. Open the item for which you want to generate the BOM report and select the BOM tab.
2. Identify the structure that you want to show in the BOM report by selecting Multi-Level, First-Level, or Parts Only from the View drop-down.
3. If you are planning to create a multi-level BOM report, modify the row order of the BOM so that the row order can be leveraged to show the level of the BOM.
4. Right click on any item in the BOM grid and select BOM Report.
5. On the Select Report Template dialog, identify the path to the BOM report template that you want to use or click Browse Files to browse to that directory.

   Important: The BOM Report template must match the structure view you selected. For example, if you selected Parts Only, you must choose a template that supports the Parts Only view.

   Note: The Browse button defaults to Report Templates directory provided by Vault.

   You can also click the drop-down arrow beside the Browse Files button to specify whether you want to browse for templates on the local machine or in a vault.
6. Select the BOM template that matches the view that you selected and click Open.
7. Verify that you have identified the correct template and click OK.

### Intrinsic BOM Row Properties

# Intrinsic BOM Row Properties

Learn about the intrinsic BOM row properties available in Vault.

There are five intrinsic BOM row properties:

* **Detail ID**

  An identifier for the BOM row. This value is not necessarily related to the order in which the rows are presented.

  Since it is often necessary to re-order rows but to maintain a unique ID for each individual row for documentation purposes, the Detail ID allows you to track your BOM rows, regardless of their order in the BOM.
* **Row Type**

  Displays whether the BOM row was added manually or imported from a CAD file.
* **Unit QTY**

  This is the unit size.
* **Item QTY**

  This is the number of items in the row.

Important: Both Unit QTY and Item QTY properties can be edited for both CAD imported and Manual rows. However, if you edit a CAD imported row, the modified values are overwritten with the values from the CAD file the next time the item is updated.

Tip: Add custom or intrinsic BOM row properties so that they are visible in the BOMs by [Customizing the BOM view](GUID-E926FCEE-9774-4329-BDCD-87BB537BFE17.htm).

See [Create a BOM Row Property Definition](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-E8EFF24A-E893-48E3-B6A3-88231D4ACA42) for information on creating custom BOM row properties.

## Change Orders

# Change Orders

Change orders are a component of the change management process that describe why, how, and when changes are made to a design.

Note: Change Orders are available only in Vault Professional.

Change order states help track the progression of the change order through the change management process. The state of the change order can determine which users can affect the change order, based on the user's role. Change orders use a routing list to control which users are notified when a Change Order enters a certain state. See [Working with Change Order States](GUID-0887FD74-C548-4118-9D20-E3126C0B7E4F.htm), for more information.

## Change Order Pre-requisites

* You must be an Administrator or Change Order Editor to create or participate in a change order.

  See Roles and Permissions for more information.
* A routing list and numbering scheme must be already be defined.

  Note: The routing list may be modified after creating the change order.

See [Change Order Administration](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-1425F5FA-80E5-4D32-BAD5-01A44A6CD529) for more information.

#### Change Order Routing Roles

# Change Order Routing Roles

When a change order is created, you must specify a routing. A routing is a list of participants with pre-defined roles. Each of the six different routing roles has specific permissions and responsibilities.

The Change Administrator, Responsible Engineer, and Approver roles control the progression of the change order. The Reviewer role can add markups, view, add, and reply to comments.

The person creating the change order automatically becomes a Reviewer on the change order routing. Any participant can add additional Reviewers to the routing as needed.

The task a routing participant can perform depends on the routing participant role.

Note: Only users with Administrator or Change Order Editor privileges can be assigned routing roles. Refer to [Manage Users and Roles](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-428B79D5-7F4B-4182-932A-D52D61BD962D) for more information.

#### Work with Change Order States

# Work with Change Order States

The state of a change order determines which change order fields can be modified and by which users.

## View the Workflow Chart for a Change Order

* The Status tab in the Change Order dialog box displays a workflow chart of all possible combinations of state progressions.
* You can also view the current status of the change order by selecting the Status tab in the Change Order dialog box. Double-click a state to view information about that state.

By default, a single participant assigned the approval role can approve a change order that is in the Review state. The routing definition can optionally require all participants with approval permission to approve a change order for it to enter the approved state.

The Change Administrator can optionally require that all participants with approval permission must approve a change order for it to enter the approved state.

Note: The Change Administrator can force the approval of an open change order.

Once a change order is fully approved, the change order enters the closed state. When the change order closes, the Change State dialog can be displayed for the associated items which allows the user to select any lifecycle state that is set for items. The conditions for displaying the Change State dialog are as follows:

* If the Change Order is closed exclusively for attached items, the Change State dialog is displayed.
* If the Change Order is closed exclusively for attached files, the Change State dialog isn't displayed.
* If the Change Order is closed for both items and files, the Change State dialog is displayed only for items.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| *Change Order State* | *Description* |
| Create | When a new change order is saved, it enters the Create state. The person requesting the change order is automatically assigned to the Change Requestor role. When the Change Requestor submits the change order, the change order enters the Open state and notification is sent to the users that have a role in the next state of the workflow.  In the Create state: the Change Requestor can perform the following actions:   * Edit * Submit * Delete   Note: The Change Requestor cannot change item lifecycle, roll back lifecyle, or update the item associated with the change order.  The change Administrator can delete the change order or submit it. Once submitted, the change order enters the Open state. Notification is sent to the Change Administrator, indicating there is a change order requiring attention. |
| Open | Open Change Orders show current data or the tip versions of the objects in the change order. In the Open state, the Change Administrator can perform the following actions:   * Edit * Submit and Force Approval * Cancel * Submit   Upon clicking Submit, the change order enters the Work state. Notification is sent to the Responsible Engineer, Change Administrator, and Change Requestor on the routing list, alerting the participants that there is a change order requiring attention. |
| Work | In the Work State,   * A Reviewer can add comments, reply to comments, and view. * The Change Requestor can add comments, reply to comments, and view. * The Change Administrator can withdraw the change order from the process or fast track the change order through the approval process. * The Responsible Engineer makes the requested design changes, and submits the change order for review. * Anyone except the Notification User can edit the routing list per rules specified in the routing section.   Once the Responsible Engineer submits the change order, it enters the Check state or the Review state based on the workflow definition specified in the Administration dialog box. |
| Check (optional) | If the change order workflow definition is set to Check State in the Administration dialog box, the change order enters the Check state when submitted by the Responsible Engineer. Notification is sent to the Checker, Change Requestor, and Reviewer alerting that the change order requires attention.  In the Check State:   * The Checker can reject or approve the change order. * The Change Requestor or the Reviewer can add comments and reply to comments.   If the Checker rejects the change order, it returns to the Work state. Once the Checker approves the change order, it enters the Review state. |
| Review | Upon a change order being submitted for review, the change order enters the Review state. Notification is sent alerting the Reviewers and the Approvers that there is a Change Order requiring their attention.  In the Review state:   * The approver can approve or reject the change order. * The change Requestor or the Reviewer can add comments and reply to comments.   For a change order to enter the Approved state:   * One Approver approves the change order if the routing definition does not specify unanimous approval. * All Approvers must approve the change order if unanimous approval is specified.   Note: If the Approver rejects the change order, the change order enters the Rejected state. In the Rejected state, the Change Administrator can re-open or cancel the change order. |
| Approved | In the Approved state, the change order can only be closed.  When a change order enters the Closed State, effectivity is immediate and notification is sent to anyone listed as a Notification User on the routing list. |
| Cancelled | In the Cancelled state, no action can be taken by anyone. |
| Closed | In the Closed state, no action can be taken by anyone.  Closed Change Orders show historical data, old versions, or revisions of objects. |

#### Synchronize Properties

# Synchronize Properties

The "Synchronize Properties" command has been added to the Records tab of the Change Order List and Change Order Detail. [A Vault Ideas submission](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/vault-ideas/synchronise-properties-in-the-eco-records-grid/idi-p/12424878)
.

On the Records tab, you can now utilize the "Synchronize Properties" command. This allows you to synchronize properties directly in the ECO records or files grid, eliminating the need to search through multiple folders to locate the updated files.

You can:

1. Right-click on the ECO Records tab.
2. Select the "Synchronize Properties" command.
3. This action will synchronize the properties.

Remember that the "Synchronize Properties" command is a handy tool designed to streamline and simplify your workflow.

### Rules and Best Practices for Using Change Orders with Files

# Rules and Best Practices for Using Change Orders with Files

Certain rules apply to closing a change order or releasing files with relationships. Follow these rules and best practices for using change orders with files.

## General Rules

* Only users with Administrator or Change Order Editor security permissions can affect change orders.
* A file can only be associated with one active change order at a time. Once a change order has been closed or cancelled, the file can be associated with a new or a currently active change order.
* Change orders do not drive file state changes. However, a change order will prevent certain lifecycle state changes for the file depending on the change order's state and if *linked to change order* is added as a criteria in the file's lifecycle transition.

## Rule for Closing a Change Order

* The change order must be in the Approved state.

## Best Practices

* As a best practice, you should add all children to a change order with an assembly. Reviewers and Approvers are notified of all affected files.
* In general, it is useful to add all files affected by a design change to the change order. For example, in Autodesk Inventor, changing a part also changes the parent assembly.

# Rules and Best Practices for Using Change Orders with Items

Certain rules apply to using change orders with items and lifecycle states, closing a change order, or releasing items with relationships. Follow these rules and best practices for using change orders with items.

## General Rules

* Only users with Administrator or Change Order Editor security permissions can affect change orders.
* An item can only be associated with one active change order at a time. Once a change order has been closed or cancelled, the item can be associated with a new or a currently active change order.
* The Change Order Administrator can make the item editable in all states except Canceled and Closed. The Responsible Engineer can make an item editable in the Work State, changing the lifecycle state. See the next section for more detail.
* An Item Editor Level 2 can edit an item associated with a change order when it is in the Work in Progress state except for the following:

  + Change State
  + New Change Order

* If a released item is added to a change order and the Change Order Administrator changes the state of the item to Work in Progress, the item changes to Work in Progress and a new revision is created according to the Bump revision action specified in the Lifecycles rules dialog box. If the Bump revision action is set to None, a new revision is not created.
* The state of an item does not change when it is attached to a change order.

  After a new revision is created, the Change Order Administrator can change the lifecycle state of the item making the item editable or non-editable by using the Change State command available from the context menu in the Change Order dialog box in the Item tab. The context menu displays the available lifecycle states.

## Rules for Closing a Change Order

* The change order must be in the Approved state.

When you close a change order, a Change State dialog displays asking if you want to change the state for assocaited items. You can modify the item states before closing the change order, or simply close the change order without making any changes.

## Best Practices

* As a best practice, you should add all children to a change order with an assembly. Reviewers and Approvers are notified of all affected items.
* In general, it is useful to add all items affected by a design change to the change order. For example, in Autodesk Inventor, changing a part also changes the parent assembly.

### Manage Change Order Notifications

# Manage Change Order Notifications

A user on the routing list is notified when the change order enters a state that requires attention.

For example, the Responsible Engineer is notified when the change order enters the Work state, but the approver does not get notified until it enters the Review state.

* The change order number is added to each participant's worklist.
* An e-mail message is sent to each person on the routing list. The administrator must configure Autodesk data management server for e-mail notification and Vault Professional users must have valid e-mail addresses in their user profiles. For more information on configuring the data management server for e-mail notification, see the server console help.
* If Vault Professional is running but inactive, an alert is sent to each person on the routing list.

## Turn ECO Notification Off or On

The pop-up message indicating an ECO has been added to your worklist can be turned off or on. By default, the pop-up notification is on.

* From the View menu, select Notification Display.

### Change Administrator and Responsible Engineer Tasks

# Change Administrator and Responsible Engineer Tasks

Change Administrators and Responsible Engineers have the greatest range of permissions and control over the change order process.

When you create a change order, you select a routing definition requiring one or more participants to approve the change order.

**Before you create a change order**: Make sure that a routing has been created by the administrator. The routing should contain everyone that needs to review, be responsible for, and approve the change order.

Note: The routing list may be edited as needed by the Change Administrator after the change order has been created. Anyone already on the routing can add a reviewer. The administrator can add or remove Approvers, Change Administrators, and Responsible Engineers.

## Permission Requirements

You must have one of the following permissions to be a Change Administrator:

* Administrator
* Change Order Editor

The data associated with an open change order can be modified by the Change Administrator.

In the Open and Review State

* Change the state of the item. Changing the state to Work In Progress allows the item to be edited. Changing it to In Review locks the item, preventing the item from being edited.

  Note: When you change the state of a released item to Work In Progress, a new revision is created. If the Bump revision action is set to None in the Lifecylce Rules dialog box a new revision is not created.

  When Change State is disabled, the lifecycle state of the item changes to In Review.
* Attach or remove files.
* Create a markup from an attached .dwf file and add a comment to the markup.
* Customize the email notification
* Add or remove items.
* Add, remove, or edit user-defined properties

#### Open State

The Change Administrator can edit the title, edit the value of a user-defined property, and change the attachment of an open change order.

The Change Administrator can perform the same editing tasks in the open state as in the state when the change order is first being created with one exception: The specified numbering scheme cannot be changed.

Change the lifecycle state of the item by using the change state command in the context menu of a selected item.

#### Work State

When a change order enters the Work state, the Responsible Engineer is notified that there is a change order requiring attention:

* The change order number is added to the work list of each participant.
* An e-mail message is sent to each person on the routing list if they have subscribed to e-mail notification for change order events.

Anyone can view the status.

A reviewer can view, add, and reply to change order comments.

The Responsible Engineer can edit the change order, as well as make the necessary revisions and then submit the change order for review.

#### Review State

* When a change order enters the Review state, routing participants are notified that there is a change order requiring attention:

  The change order number is added to each participant's work list.
* An e-mail message is sent to each person on the routing list if they have subscribed to e-mail notification for change order events.

A reviewer can view, add, and reply to change order comments.

Anyone can view the status.

#### Approved State

A participant with approver status can approve a change order.

The Change Administrator can change the life cycle state of the item by selecting an item and selecting Change State from the context menu. Only the allowable state changes are displayed.

Items are effective immediately when released.

#### Rejected State

A participant with Approver status can reject a change order.

As a Change Administrator, you can do the following to a rejected change order:

* Cancel the Change Order
* Reopen the change order

## Custom Objects

# Custom Objects

Learn about Custom Objects.

Custom Objects allow Vault administrators to use an extensible system to create new Vault entities to meet the needs of their team, organization, or company. Right out-of-the-box, the administrator can create a Custom Object definition and assign it categories, lifecycles, and properties. Once the Custom Object definition is created, users can create instances of that custom object directly through the user interface. As with files and folders, users can perform many common Vault tasks with custom objects.

## Custom Object Definitions vs. Custom Object Instances

There are two concepts to the Custom Objects entity class. They are Custom Object definitions and a Custom Object instances.

## Custom Object Definition

* The Custom Object definition is the type of entity that is being created. For example, an administrator can create a custom object definition called Contacts or Tasks.

  Custom Object Definitions are created, edited, and deleted on the Configure Custom Objects Dialog. You can access the Configure Custom Objects Dialog through the Custom Objects Tab on the Vault Settings dialog. You must be an administrator to create and modify custom object definitions.

## Custom Object Instance

* When the user creates a new custom object based on a definition, this is considered an instance. For example, an administrator creates a custom object definition called Contact. A user could then create an instance of that custom object called Bob Smith.
* Users can attach files, folders, and other Vault entities to a custom object with a link.

  For example, if a custom object definition has been created called Tasks and a user has created a task called Review John's Design, the task (Review John's Design) can be linked to John's design in the vault.
* Custom Object instances can be checked in, checked out, undergo a change state, and managed with many common Vault commands. Similarly, linked objects are also affected, depending on the user's settings for the Vault function.

  For example, if a user wants to check out a custom object and the custom object has links to files, folders, items, or change orders; the files associated with that linked data are gathered and checked out as well.

### Add a New Custom Object Instance

# Add a New Custom Object Instance

A custom object definition must be configured before you can add a new instance of that custom object.

The Administrator can create new custom object definitions on the [Configure Custom Object Definition](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-E1BA9E4A-443F-43EA-B8BF-3CAA382C25A3) dialog.

Note: Newly created or edited Custom Object definitions will not populate in the Vault Client until the following login.

Add a new custom object instance by performing one of these steps:

1. Select the Custom Object Definition's view button in the lower left of the navigation pane.

   In the following example, there are two types of custom objects that have been defined: Contacts and Tasks. The image shows the user selecting Tasks.

   ![](../images/customobjects-tasksbutton.png)
2. Click New on the toolbar and select New *<custom object>*, where *<custom object>* is the name of the custom object definition from which you want to create an instance.

   In the following example, the user is creating a new Task.

   ![](../images/customobjects-new.png)

   Note: You can also right-click on the custom object node in the tree and select New Task.
3. On the New *<custom object>* dialog, enter a name for the custom object instance.

   For example, this user may want to create an instance of Tasks called Review John's Design.

   ![](../images/customobjects-newtaskdialog.png)
4. Click OK.

   The new custom object instance is added.

**Parent page:** [Custom Objects](GUID-582E4F75-420D-4B77-8433-D41EBC041317.htm)


### Edit a Custom Object Instance

# Edit a Custom Object Instance

There are several ways to modify an existing custom object instance. These modifications are made on the instance and not the entire definition.

For example, edits made to a specific Task, such as Review John's Design, are not being made to the entire Tasks definition. The commands available for custom objects are listed below with a short description of each function.

Note: Refer to the Vault topic for the specified command for more information.

## Check In

Selecting [Check In](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-94955FE3-C965-428E-B116-48ACA128D59B) on a custom object instance will gather all files that are associated with all linked data. So if the custom object has links to files, folders, items, or change orders; the files associated with that linked data will be gathered and checked in.

## Get/Check Out

Selecting [Get/Check Out](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-F64CF492-8F37-4A35-AE00-25835D82AD50) on a custom object will download and optionally check out the files associated with the links in the custom object. So if the custom object has links to files, folders, items, or change orders; the files associated with that linked data will be gathered and downloaded/checked out.

## Undo Check Out

Like check in and check out, the undo check out command will undo any check outs needed for files associated with data linked to the custom object.

## Change Category

The Change Category command assigns a new category to a custom object. Links to custom objects of the same definition can be included on the change category dialog.

## Change State

The state can be changed on a custom object as well as any links to the same definition type. So. for example, if a Tasks custom object has been defined, and a task instance has links to other tasks, then all linked tasks can be included in the change state operation.

## Delete

Custom Object instances can be deleted as long as the roles and permissions assigned to the definition and instance allow it. Any links to that instance prompt a dialog to confirm the delete.

## Rename

Custom objects can be renamed with the Rename command. The dialog used for custom objects is similar to the rename folder command.

## Go To

The Go To command takes the user to the source of a link. If this command is chosen on a link to a custom object, the user is taken to the source of the link.

## Details

Selecting this command populates the general properties and security dialog for the custom object. It is here that a [security override](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-67F7EED5-76C4-4C6F-806C-74D1518A8FF2) can be applied to an instance.

**Parent page:** [Custom Objects](GUID-582E4F75-420D-4B77-8433-D41EBC041317.htm)


### Custom Objects and Categories

# Custom Objects and Categories

Categories can be assigned to custom objects in two ways: when the custom object is created and when the user performs a change category event on the custom object.

By assigning custom object instances to a category, properties and lifecycle definitions associated with the category are automatically applied to the instance.

See [Work with User-Defined Properties](GUID-5F0C9F22-0288-471E-8D64-D5F57FBE300A.htm) for more information.

**Parent page:** [Custom Objects](GUID-582E4F75-420D-4B77-8433-D41EBC041317.htm)


### Custom Objects and Lifecycles

# Custom Objects and Lifecycles

Just like files and folders, when a custom object is assigned a category, it automatically inherits the associated lifecycle definition. Lifecycles can be configured to automate certain behaviors based on the custom object's status in the lifecycle. Lifecycle settings are configured by the administrator.

See [Lifecycles Administration](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-088F0236-B5B7-4E35-B218-BD2D253B87F6) for more information.

**Parent page:** [Custom Objects](GUID-582E4F75-420D-4B77-8433-D41EBC041317.htm)


### Custom Objects and Properties

# Custom Objects and Properties

Categories can also be used to assign user-defined properties to Custom Objects.

There are also out-of-the-box properties specific to custom objects, such as Custom Object Name and Custom Object System Name.

See [Work with User-Defined Properties](GUID-5F0C9F22-0288-471E-8D64-D5F57FBE300A.htm) for more information.

**Parent page:** [Custom Objects](GUID-582E4F75-420D-4B77-8433-D41EBC041317.htm)


### View Custom Object Properties

# View Custom Object Properties

For custom objects, the properties available are the icon, the name of the instance, custom object type, and lifecycle state.

Follow these steps to view the properties of a custom object instance.

1. Right-click on a custom object instance in the vault.
2. Select Properties.
3. In the Properties dialog box, select the General tab to view the General properties for the instance.
4. Select the Security tab to see the roles and permissions assigned to the instance.

Note: See [Editing and Overriding Custom Object Security](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-67F7EED5-76C4-4C6F-806C-74D1518A8FF2) for more information about modifying the security on a custom object definition or custom object instance.

## Vault Office Client

# Vault Office Client

The Vault Office client is similar to the Vault client, but provides only non-CAD file and folder data management options.

The Vault Office client cannot be [installed](tpicid=GUID-508F607E-BEFA-4E79-82B5-6A1BBFBD3DBC) on the same machine as a full Vault Professional client.

## Who Should Use the Vault Office client?

The Vault Office client is ideal for users who do not need all of the CAD functionality of a full Vault client, but who still need to manage documents in a vault. For example, non-design engineers and project managers, employees on the shop floor, and sales personnel could all use the Vault Office client to fulfill these responsibilities:

* Review and validate design data
* Participate in the change process
* Manage project data
* Communicate with external team members
* Create reports
* Consume released design data
* Manage additional non-CAD data and custom objects.

You can preview files using the View tab if dwf exist for these files and "Inventor Read-Only Mode" is selected in Vault Options. If the files don't have dwf, you can only view files in Inventor in the Inventor Read-only mode using the "Open" button in the View tab or "View in Window..." command in the context menu. If files have dwf, but "Always use Inventor Read-Only Mode" is selected in Options, you can only view files in Inventor Read-only mode.

You can also configure the default behavior for double-clicking a file with the Invoke with double-click setting changed to View in Window in the Options.

## Tasks Users Can Perform with the Vault Office client

### File and Folder Tasks

* Create folders
* Move, Rename, and Delete non-CAD files
* Move, Rename, and Delete folders which do not contain CAD files

Search provides a quick and convenient way to locate files and folders.

## Search Bar

Click Search in the navigation bar to expand the search field.

![](../images/thinclient-searchfield.png)

The current workspace, indicated by the drop-down menu to the left of the search field, is automatically selected when you click the Search bar. Click the menu to select a different workspace.

![](../images/thinclient-searchoptions.png)

Note: Switching the workspace clears all existing search criteria and results.

The search "Find Latest Version Only" option in the Files and Items workspace depends on the "Show latest version of file/item only" option set under the Administrator Settings.

* If the "Show latest version of file/item" option is turned on in the Administrator Settings, the "Find Latest Version Only" search option is selected and disabled.
* If the "Show latest version of file/item" option is turned off in the Administrator Settings, you can select whether to enable or disable the "Find Latest Version Only" search option.

## Basic Search

Use Basic Search to look for any property that contains the search keyword. With Basic Search, you can search objects in different workspaces.

* **Files** - a basic search locates files and folders in the current folder and/or subfolders, and optionally, searches the latest version only.
* **Items** - a basic search locates only items, and optionally, searches the latest version only.
* **Change Orders** - a basic search locates only change orders.

To perform a basic search:

* Select the search workspace.
* Select the search option - Current folder and/or Include Subfolders or Find Latest Version Only. By default, the "Include Subfolders" option is selected.

  If the "Current Folder" option is deselected, the option "Include Subfolders" is deselected by default too.
* Enter your search string in the search input field and press enter.

![](../images/thinclient-basicsearchfield.png)

When a search is performed, the main view displays the results of the search. Click Clear to clear the search input field.

![](../images/thinclient-basicsearchresult.png)

## Advanced Search

Use Advanced Search to create complex queries with multiple search criteria.

You can search objects anywhere in a vault or in different workspaces using the advanced search criteria. By default, an advanced search is initiated in the workspace from where it is launched. For instance, if you are in the Items workspace and you perform the Advanced Search, the search returns results only from the Items workspace.

To perform an advanced search you need to specify a property, a condition, and a value. You can initiate the search either clicking Search in the navigation bar, or clicking on the "Advanced" text button located next to the search field.

To perform an advanced search:

* In the Advanced Search tab, select the search workspace from the "Search for" drop-down.

  ![](../images/thinclient-advancedsearchoptions.png)
* Specify the search criteria.
* Click ![](../images/icon-search-plus.png) to add criteria as needed.

## Vault Add-ins

# Vault Add-ins

Autodesk Vault integrates with your design software using an add-in. The add-in brings the basic file management functionality of Autodesk Vault into the designer's environment.

Note: Refer to the [Supported Vault Add-ins](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-334CC890-1F12-429C-9D6A-B964327CA590) table for a complete list of products that integrate with Vault.

Autodesk Vault manages all your design and engineering files, regardless of the file type. Files can be Autodesk Inventor, AutoCAD, Revit, Moldflow, 3Ds Max, Microsoft Office, or any other file used in a design's lifecycle. You can organize all of your files and keep them in one location for easy access. All file versions are retained, so you never misplace or replace past versions. The vault stores each version of a file, along with all the file's dependencies, giving you a living history of the project as you work on it. The vault also stores file properties such as the user name, date, and comments for rapid searching and retrieving.

In a design team, all the files and associated data are stored on the server so all users have access to the information and its history. Each member of a team must have a unique login name and password. Team members check out files to prevent more than one member from editing the same file at the same time. Once a file is checked back into the vault, team members can refresh their local copies of the model file to get the latest version from the vault, so all members of the design team work together.

### AutoCAD Vault Add-in

# AutoCAD Vault Add-in

Learn about the AutoCAD Vault Add-in.

Autodesk Vault integrates with AutoCAD and AutoCAD Mechanical software using an AutoCAD Vault ARX application.

Note: Vault commands are not supported in SDI (single-document) mode. The SDI system variable must be set to '0' for vault commands to be supported.

Autodesk Vault is both a server and a client interface.

* The server provides the following:

  + **Centralized file store:** Autodesk Vault server stores the master copies of all your documents and designs and keeps the master copies of all user files in a common, secure, and centralized location. By storing all of your data in a common, centralized location, you can easily share and manage all of your information with your design team. The files are stored on the server in such a way that they can be easily retrieved using the server console. However, this file store can reside on a different drive or even on a completely different server from the vault database.
  + **Relational database:** Autodesk Vault server contains a database that stores data about the files, such as file names, user names, properties, versions, and relationships between files. The database is managed using the server console.
  + **Access and information:** The Autodesk Vault Server software provides users with access to their files and maintains information about the status of those files including which users have permission to change and update the files. When changes are made to files Autodesk Vault maintains a version history of all changes and provides a convenient mechanism for users to gain access to the latest versions as well as previous versions.
* The client consists of two components:

  + **Autodesk Vault:** Autodesk Vault is a stand-alone client providing full access to the vault. This is the user interface for managing all data within the vault.

#### Autodesk Vault and AutoCAD Vault ARX

# Autodesk Vault and AutoCAD Vault ARX

Autodesk Vault software is a client-server application. In a typical installation, you install the server portion of the software on a shared computer, and then install the client software (Autodesk Vault and AutoCAD Vault ARX) on individual workstations. During installation, you have the option to install each of the components required for each workstation and, when applicable, for each server.

The vault server stores and maintains the files and metadata that make up the vault. The server software can be installed on a server or workstation that is shared by all users or, for a single user, the server can be installed along with the client on a single, isolated workstation. The database is managed by the server console.

The vault client consists of autodesk-vault-and-autocad-vault-arx. The client is installed on all workstations that need to access the vault.

## Key Concepts for AutoCAD Vault ARX

The essential rules to remember when working with AutoCAD Vault ARX are:

1. The files in the vault are the master files.
2. You must check a file out of the vault to modify it.
3. To check out a file for editing you must use the working folder on the local disk. Each user can optionally set a local working folder (physical-location-on-disk) for the root of the vault or use the default working folder (My Documents\Vault).

## AutoCAD Vault ARX for AutoCAD and AutoCAD Mechanical

AutoCAD Vault ARX is tightly integrated into AutoCAD and AutoCAD Mechanical. You can perform vault tasks using the AutoCAD Menus, command line, or the External References palette for files containing xrefs.

Check out and check in capabilities prevent more than one user from editing a file at one time, so all members of the design team to work together. In host files containing Xrefs, you can view the status of vaulted files displayed by icons and properties in the External References palette. The status icons in the External References palette keep all members of the design team informed of the status of files.

Note: Vault commands are not supported in SDI (single-document) mode. The SDI system variable must be set to '0' for vault commands to be supported.

AutoCAD Vault ARX understands the relationship between a host file, and all files that it references so you can manage all files in a model within the External References palette.

## AutoCAD Vault ARX for AutoCAD Electrical

AutoCAD Vault ARX is tightly integrated into AutoCAD Electrical. You can perform vault tasks using the AutoCAD Menus, command line, or Project Manager.

AutoCAD Vault ARX understands the relationship between a project file, and all files that it references so you can manage all files in a model within the Project Manager. The AutoCAD Electrical project file (\*.wdp) lists all drawing files included in the project. The drawing file names are maintained with relative paths from the location of the project definition file. When you make a change in one drawing, all files related to that drawing are automatically updated as well. To maintain the relationship between the drawing files that are defined in the project file you must check out all files specified in a project file when you need to modify one or more files.

Check out and check in capabilities prevent more than one user from editing a file at one time, so all members of the design team work together. The Project vault commands do not require that the selected project is active; it only needs to be open in the current Project Manager.

#### About Inventor Link File and Autodesk Vault

# About Inventor Link File and Autodesk Vault

When an Inventor Link File is checked into the vault, the associated IPT file or IAM file is linked to the Inventor Link File (DWG) in AutoCAD Mechanical.

In Autodesk Vault , the Uses and Where Used tab display the parent/child relationship between the Autodesk Inventor IPT or IAM file and the Inventor Link file.

The following is a list of best practices to follow when working with Inventor Link files:

* The Autodesk Inventor files must be checked into the vault before creating an Inventor Link file.
* When working with a vault, you must have a copy of the Autodesk Inventor part or assembly file located in your working folder to create a link between an Inventor Link File and the part or assembly file. Copy the Autodesk Inventor part or assembly file to your working folder by performing a Refresh From Vault in Autodesk Explorer.
* In AutoCAD Mechanical , select the application menu ![](../images/icon-appmenu-acad-2014.png) .
* Next, select the New Inventor Link file. Select the part file from your working folder.

  Save the Inventor Link file to the same working folder the part files reside in.
* In AutoCAD Mechanical, save the Inventor Link file and then check it into the vault after saving the file.

Checking the Inventor Link file into the vault allows the vault to manage the relationship between the Autodesk Inventor file and the Inventor Link file.

For detailed help on how to create and update an Inventor Link file, see the AutoCAD Mechanical Help.

#### Check In Settings

# Check In Settings

Configure your Check In settings to control how files are stored in a vault.

File Structure options provide a great deal of flexibility when it comes to reorganizing and rearranging files so that they are added to the vault in a vault-friendly manner.

Note: You cannot have two or more files with the same name in the same folder.

|  |
| --- |
| *Access:* |
|  | In the Check In dialog box, click the Settings button. |

These settings determine how files will be added to the vault and are only available the first time files are added to the vault.

Once the files are checked into the Vault in a manner specified below, anyone checking out those files brings this same structure down to their local working folder.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| *Use organized folder structure* | The root folder is the top level folder within a hierarchical folder tree. The folder structure is maintained for all folders that are at the same level or beneath the host file. All referenced files and folders existing outside the directory tree of the Host are brought into a single folder under the host. |
| *Place all files in one folder* | All xrefs and dependent files are flattened so that they exist at the same level as the host. All the files are located under the vault folder. |
| *Preserve locations if in working folder* | Maintains the file structure of files being checked in from the local working folder. As a best practice, always work within the working folder and preserve the file locations. |
| *Create Visualization Attachment* | Creates and attaches a visualization file to the design file being checked in. |
| *Apply to All Files* | Creates a visualization file attachment for all files being checked in. This option must be turned on to create visualization files for children. |
| *Include* | Indicates which of the following tabs to include in the visualization file:   * Model Tab Only * Layout Tab Only * Model and Layout Tabs * <Use Default Vault Settings> - use the settings specified on the Publish Options dialog in the vault client. |

#### Context Menu Options for the AutoCAD Vault Add-in

# Context Menu Options for the AutoCAD Vault Add-in

The context menu options are accessed from the selected node in the File Reference pane or from the background menu of the External References palette window.

The type of node selected and status of the selected node determines which commands are available.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| *Open* | Opens selected file in a new AutoCAD window. |
| *Attach* | Attaches a new instance of the selected file node reference into the current drawing. If the host file is not yet checked out, you are prompted to check out the file before the new reference is attached.  Note: The newly attached files are not automatically added to the vault. You must check in the newly added file reference into the vault for it to be added as a dependency of the host file. |
| *Attach from Vault* | Use to reuse and share files. Browse through the vault and select a file to attach to the current drawing. The resulting attachment is a library or shared file. The term Library File appears in the tooltip after the file name for the file that is attached from a library folder in the vault. A file not attached from the library folder is a shared file. Only image and drawing files can be attached. You must check the host file out of the vault to attach a file from the vault. |
| *Unload* | Unloads the selected file reference from memory. Unloading a file results in the drawing opening faster and using less memory. The xref definition is unloaded from the drawing file, but the pointer to the reference drawing remains. |
| *Reload* | Updates the xrefs in the current drawing. You can cancel the download by clicking the Cancel button on the progress dialog box. |
| *Detach* | Detaches selected file reference from the current file. You must check out the host file out of the vault to remove it as a file reference. |
| *Bind* | Embeds an externally referenced file into the drawing file so that it is no longer an xref. If you bind an xref into the current drawing, the xref and all its dependent named objects become a part of the current drawing. You must check the host file out of the vault to use this command. If the local copy of the xref is older than the version in the vault, you are prompted to get the latest version. |
| *Check In* | Adds a file to the vault and creates a new version of the file. |
| *Check Out* | Reserves and locks the master file. Retrieves an updated copy, if necessary. |
| *Undo Checkout* | Removes the reservation/lock from the master file. The master file is now available for others to check out. Any modifications made to the local copy are not checked back into the vault. |
| *Refresh from Vault* | Gets the correct version of the drawing from the vault and then reloads the file. |
| *Refresh All Files from Vault* (AutoCAD Electrical only) | Gets the correct version of all project drawings from the vault and then reloads the files. |
| *Get Revision*  (Available in Autodesk Vault Professional) | Checks out a specific revision of the file and copies it to the local folder. |
| *Change State*  (Available in Autodesk Vault Professional) | Modifies a file or group of files' lifecycle state to enforce certain process behaviors. |
| *Revise*  (Available in Autodesk Vault Professional) | Creates a new revision of a file or selected group of files. |
| *Show Details* (Available in Autodesk Vault Professional) | View information from vault about designs and perform vault tasks. |
| *Go to Vault Folder* (Available in Autodesk Vault Professional) | Go to a file directly in vault from within AutoCAD. |

#### Extracting File Properties

# Extracting File Properties

When a DWG is added to a vault, the property values in the DWG Property dialog box are automatically extracted from the file and stored in the vault database.

Note: When dealing with block attributes containing multi-line text, you can map into the vault only. Properties do not retain multi-line text formatting when extracted from the vault. Furthermore, when the property is written back to the title block it will not retain multi-line text formatting.

The property values in attributed blocks can also be extracted by adding the name of the attributed block to the Index Block Attributes dialog box in the server console.

Note: Only the property values in the first instance of an attributed block are extracted.

Extracting these properties makes the following available in Autodesk Vault:

* Quick reference to properties associated with the file: You can choose these properties to appear as columns.
* File sorting capabilities based on those properties: You can sort or group the data by their property value.
* Advanced file searching based on properties or file content: You can search the vault for specific file content.

A thumbnail image of the DWG file is also extracted. In Autodesk Vault you can customize your view to display any of these properties, including the thumbnail image.

Note: The RASTERPREVIEW variable must be set to 1 to extract the thumbnail image.

## Procedures

**Extract Block Attribute Properties**

Use the Index Block Attributes command in the server console to extract the property data within attributed blocks. Extracting this data, allows this information to be available to you within Autodesk Vault. You can add this data as a property field and search for files containing data within an attributed block that you have added within the server console.

Note: You must have an attributed block in a file that has been checked into the vault to extract this data.

1. In the server console, from the Tools menu, select Index Block Attributes.
2. In the Index Block Attributes dialog box, click New and enter the name of the attributed block whose properties you want to be made available in Autodesk Vault.
3. Click OK to complete the operation.

The property data within the attributed block is now available for display with Autodesk Vault. Refer to the Help in Autodesk Vault for more information on customizing and displaying fields.

#### Generate File Number

# Generate File Number

Automatic file numbering allows you to easily organize your files with systematic naming schemes.

Note: This feature is available for the AutoCAD and AutoCAD Mechanical Vault Add-ins.

When you are logged into a vault and enact the Save As function for a file, you can have the system automatically append a set of predefined characters to the file name based on the scheme configured in the Autodesk Vault client. This feature allows you to enforce file naming conventions and prevents duplicate file names from being created.

The default scheme is Sequential. Use this scheme to number files sequentially. Other numbering schemes can be designed in the Autodesk Vault client. See the Autodesk Vault client help for more information.

## Generate File Number

To generate a file number for a new file, a numbering scheme must be enabled in the Autodesk Vault client. You must also be logged into a vault before performing the Save As function.

Note: Refer to the Autodesk Vault client for more information.

1. Make sure you are logged into a vault.
2. Save the file for the first time or select the Application icon and then select Save As.

   The Generate File Number dialog opens.
3. Select the numbering scheme that you want to use from the Scheme drop-down menu.
4. Change any values in the free text Number fields or select existing options from a list.
5. Click Save to save the file with the new name.

#### Geospatial Properties Extraction and Indexing

# Geospatial Properties Extraction and Indexing

Learn about extracting and indexing geospatial properties.

The extraction of identified Geospatial properties will occur during:

1. First time adding of ACAD drawings into Vault via ACAD add-in and/or Vault Client
2. Subsequent checking-in of ACAD drawings into Vault

The indexing of Geospatial properties will be done by default, and automatically without additional configuration by Vault administrator. Likewise, when Vault administrator invokes a 'Re-indexing Properties' server task, it will work on geospatial properties too.

Geospatial properties are extracted as file properties named 'GeoRSS', which could be configured to be displayed as User Defined Properties in Vault Client.

# Learn about the External References Palette with the AutoCAD Vault Add-in

You can perform most vault tasks within the External References palette when you are logged into a vault.

You can manage the relationships between a host file and its xrefs in the vault. Standard xref operations continue to be available. The AutoCAD Vault Add-in adds vault functionality to the External References palette.

When you install the Vault add-in, the External References palette becomes a dockable Enhanced Standard Window (ESW) that supports both drawing xrefs and image files in the same window. The External References palette supports most Vault operations and status icons. The Vault commands are only available when you are logged into a vault.

Note: The Vault commands are also available from the File menu and the command line.

## External References Palette Operations

The Vault commands are available by right-clicking a file within the External References palette. The state and kind of file selected determines which commands are available.

You can use the External References palette to:

* **Check files in and out of a vault**

  You must check out the file to the working folder on your local drive to edit it. When you finish working on the file, you must check the file back into the vault so that others on the design team can view your updates.

  Tip: If you want others to view updates you made to a file and you want to continue modifying the file, select the Keep files checked out option on the Check In dialog box. This checks in the updates you made to the file and keeps the file checked out to you.

  Note: You must have all references of a host file downloaded to your working folder to edit the host file.
* **View the status of files in a design.**

  Vault status icons indicate the status of your local copy of the files as compared against the copy of those same files in the vault. The vault status icons indicate when the local copy is in sync with the vault and when it is not. Tooltips provide descriptions of the icons. Pause the cursor over a status icon to see a detailed description. The tooltips also help guide you to the next logical steps, especially when the local copy is no longer in sync.

  Note: The vault status icons are available in the list view and treeview, and only appear when you are logged into a vault.
* **Get the latest version of a file**

  The Refresh Files command compares the local file version with the version in the vault. If the local version is older than the version in the vault, the latest version is copied from the vault to the local working folder and the current drawing is reloaded.
* **Reuse and share common data**

  Attach from the vault command attaches a new instance of a file from the vault. The instance can be attached as either a library file or a shared file.
* **Attach, Detach, Unload, Bind**

  All standard xref operations remain available in the External References palette. Although the behavior of these commands are the same as when you are not logged into the vault, the following additional operations are required:

  + **Attach:** You must check out the host file to attach a new file. Newly attached files are not automatically added to the vault. You must check in a newly added file references to the vault for it to be added as a dependency of the host file.
  + **Detach, Unload and Bind:** You must check out the host file to complete the operation.

  Note: Refer to Xrefs in the AutoCAD help topics index for information on standard Xref concepts.

## Library Files

Most organizations have either created or purchased a collection of part and assembly files that are commonly used in design, for instance, fasteners, electrical component, and pneumatic components. These library files are typically static in nature, are reused often in many different designs, and are standard within an organization.

You can attach a library file directly from the vault to your current drawing. A file becomes a library file by checking the file into a library folder in the vault.

Note: Only host library files can be checked out from the AutoCAD Vault ARX. You must use the Autodesk Vault client to check out XREF library files.

Library files are not identified by a particular icon. Instead, the term is inserted [Library File] in the tooltip after the file name.

Note: If the host file is a library item, the library icon will appear as the file type.

Access to vault folders depends upon the permissions you have been granted. You cannot see files or folders you do not have permission to view.

## Basic External Reference Palette Tasks

The behavior of the External References palette is the same when you are logged in to a vault as when you are not logged into a vault. Refer to "Xrefs" in the AutoCAD Help topics index for information on standard Xref concepts and procedures.

The workflow for using the External References palette on a system that has AutoCAD Vault ARX installed is different than the workflow for using External References palette on a system that does not have AutoCAD Vault ARX installed.

**Access the External References Palette**

Use the External References palette to perform most vault tasks. You must be logged into the vault to perform vault tasks in the External References palette.

Note: The External References palette and standard xref commands are available when you are not logged into the vault.

|  |
| --- |
| *Access:* |
| Click Insert tab > Reference panel > Dialog box launcher. |

Note: You must be logged into the vault to perform vault tasks in the External References palette.

## Attach an xref

#### Sheet Set Manager Integration

# Sheet Set Manager Integration

Learn about the Sheet Set Manager Integration with Vault.

Note: Sheet Set Manager integration is only supported in Vault Professional.

A sheet set is an organized collection of sheets from several drawing files. A sheet is a selected layout from a drawing file.

Sets of drawings are the primary deliverable for most design groups. Sets of drawings communicate the overall design intent of a project and provide the documentation and specifications for the project. However, managing sets of drawings manually can be complicated and time consuming.

The Sheet Set Manager integration lets you store your sheets in a vault. You can also work on vaulted sheet sets online or offline.

## Who Can Work with Sheet Sets?

* Edit folder user-defined properties to check sheet sets into a vault
* File rename permission to rename and renumber sheet sets in the Sheet Set Manager
* File move permissions to move sheet sets in the Sheet Set Manager

## To Change the Sheet Set Automatic Check In Visualization Attachment Options

1. Exit AutoCAD.
2. Open the file ‘Preferences.xml’ at ‘%appdata%\Autodesk\AutoCAD [Version] Vault AddIn\Objects’ with any text editor.
3. Under the respective AutoCAD profile ‘CheckIn On Auto Checkin SheetSet Options’, look for .
4. Replace the default value, 'No DWF', with one of the following:

   * 'Create DWF locally' to create visualization during Check In
   * 'Create DWF using Job Server' to send to the Job Server

## Important Rules Regarding Sheet Set Behavior

There are a few rules regarding working with vaulted sheet sets.

* Any moves or rename events of sheet set data files (dss, dsu and dsh) in Vault Client are ignored when the changed sheet set is opened in SSM. To get the updated sheet set, perform an 'Open Sheet Set from Vault' on the affected sheet set. When the sheet set is downloaded, all changes are reflected.
* Only the leading, or tip, version of the current revision is retrieved when you Refresh from Vault from the Sheet Set Manager.

##### Understanding Sheet Sets and Vault

# Understanding Sheet Sets and Vault

Sheet Set Manager (SSM) integration allows you to check in sheet set data into vault, and utilizing Vault existing capabilities.

Once you start working on a Sheet Set in vault environment, there are some changes to how certain Sheet Set commands work.

## Resave All Sheets

When you work on a sheet set with vault, youa re working in a collaborative environment. When you resave all sheets, you will notice some differences when:

* Working in a shared sandbox environment, you can Resave All as long as none of the sheets/files involved is currently checked out by other users. The Resave All command will be aborted if there are files that cannot be checked out and, therefore, saved. A file may not be available for check out if it is currently checked out to another user or if vault constraints restrict access to the file.
* Working in a non-shared sandbox environment, you can Resave All even if some of the files are checked out by other users. You will get a list of files that are not available for saving when the sheet set command is completed.

## Remove Sheet or Sheet Subset

When you remove a sheet or subset from a vaulted sheet set, its equivalent vaulted copy will NOT be removed automatically. As a result, if you were to re-use the same sheet or sheet subset name, you will be informed that the files already exist in the Vault.

If the removed sheet or sheet subset files are expired or redundant, you may remove them via Vault Client.

Note: Historical references from sheets or sheet set files are lost when they are removed with Vault Client.

## Move, Rename, and Copy Design in the Vault Client\*\*

Move, Rename, and Copy Design changes made in the Vault Client are ignored when you open the edited sheet set in SSM.

##### Working with Legacy Sheet Sets in Vault

# Working with Legacy Sheet Sets in Vault

Sheet Sets that are added to a vault without using the Sheet Set Manager lose the benefits of the Vault integration with Sheet Set Manager feature. To fully use the integration feature, a DST in Vault must be converted to a DSS.

To convert a DST in Vault to a DSS

1. Download the DST file to your working folder.
2. Open the DST file in Sheet Set Manager from your working folder.
3. Check the file in to the Vault.

   The DST file will be converted to DSS format upon check-in.

##### Extract Sheet Set Properties

# Extract Sheet Set Properties

Sheet Set properties can be extracted and searched in Vault if corresponding property definitions exist in Vault.

Following is the process to extract Sheet / Sheet Set properties. If you are not familiar with how to administer properties in Vault, please see [Administration - Properties](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-26645DD0-AC27-4CFB-BC15-41719B5DE609) before proceeding further:

1. Create a user-defined property in Vault using File association.
2. Create mapping (read-only) using the provider, Sheet Set Data

   1. Select Import From Vault to import properties
   2. Browse and select a data file for Sheet (.dsh) or Sheet Set (.dss) based on whether it is a Sheet or Sheet Set property that you would like to extract
3. Complete the property definition process and add the UDPs to a Sheet / Sheet Set

Note:

1. Only read mapping is supported for Sheet / Sheet Set properties.
2. Block attributes that map to Sheet / Sheet Set properties can be extracted and searched upon in Vault using the above procedure. However, they can be edited only from Sheet Set Manager interface.

##### Working on an Offline Vaulted Sheet Set

# Working on an Offline Vaulted Sheet Set

The **VLTSAVETODST** command allows you to continue working on a vaulted sheet set after logging out from a vault.

When you are logged out of the vault, you are considered to be working in offline mode. This command will:

* convert vaulted sheet set data (dss) into the local equivalent DST file.
* save the DST file in the same working folder as the vaulted sheet set.

As well as during a manual save, the Vault add-in will automatically save an offline DST copy of the active sheet set when you:

* Log out from the Vault
* Close the AutoCAD application
* Close the Sheet Set (via SSM)

## Export to DST File

Use the VLTSAVETODST command to create a DST file. When youa re not logged into the vault, you can use the DST file to work on your sheet set offline.

1. Type **VLTSAVETODST** in the command line and press Enter.
2. Navigate to the working folder of your vaulted sheet set, and locate the newly converted DST file in that folder.

Note: A DST file created by VLTSAVETODST command will always overwrite the local copy prior to backing up the local copy as \*.dst.bak.

#### Using the AutoCAD Electrical Project Manager with the Vault Add-in

# Using the AutoCAD Electrical Project Manager with the Vault Add-in

When working with AutoCAD Electrical and Autodesk Vault, you check out projects or individual drawings from a vault location to edit. You can perform all vault tasks within the Project Manager when you are logged into the vault.

You can also manage the relationships between a project file and its dependents in the vault, while standard project management operations continue to be available.

Note: For additional information on Project Manager commands, see "projects" in the AutoCAD Electrical Help topics.

AutoCAD Vault ARX adds vault features to the Project Manager once logged into the Vault. The vault commands are available by right-clicking on a project or drawing within the AutoCAD Electrical Project Manager. You can use the Project Manager to:

* **Log in and out of the vault**

  Upon initial start-up of AutoCAD Electrical you are not logged into the vault. You must log into Autodesk Vault to work with projects in the vault. You can also log into the vault using the Autodesk Vault ribbon.
* **Check projects in and out of the vault**

  The most basic requirement of the vault is that you never work directly on a file in the vault. You must check out the project to the working folder on your local drive to edit it. When you finish working on the project, you must check the project back into the vault.

  When a project file and its related drawing files are checked out of a vault, only the files that are not currently checked out are downloaded. If the working copy of a file is older than the version in the vault, you are prompted to replace the working copy. If the working copy is currently checked out, it is not replaced.

  Tip: If you want others to view updates you made to a project and you want to continue modifying the project, select the Keep Checked Out option on the Check In dialog box. This checks in the updates you made to the project and keeps the project checked out to you.

  Note: You must have all references of a project file downloaded to your working folder to edit the project file.
* **View the status of files in a design.**

  The status icons indicate the status of your local files as compared to the same files in the vault. You can tell when the local copy is in sync with the vault and when it is not. The tooltip for each status icon describes the state of the file and suggests the next logical step. The status of a local file is updated when it is saved to disk.

  Note: The vault status icons are available in list view and treeview, and only appear when you are logged into the vault.

Note: Access to vault folders depends upon the permissions you've been granted. You cannot see files or folders you do not have permissions for viewing.

## Project File Versioning Rules

The following rules apply to the project definition file (\*.wdp) Check In commands. The.wdp file is associated with the latest drawing files in the vault that are listed in the project definition file.

Note: Versioning of a project definition file requires the file to be checked out prior to running the Check In command.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *Project Check In All* | Adds the project definition file into the vault along with all files you have checked out. The project file is associated to all drawing files being checked in along with the latest version drawings already in the vault. Files used to support the project (such as \\*.wdl and \\*.wdt) appear in the Vault Check In dialog box if they share the same file name as the project. | |
|  | *First time check in* | The project definition file may have one or many drawings that need to be added to the vault along with the project file for the first time. Once the project and drawings have been added to the vault, the drawing files are associated with this version of the project file. Upon initial (first time) check in of the project definition file, the version number is 1. |
|  | *.wdp checked out* | The .wdp file is associated to the drawing files listed in the Vault Check In dialog box along with the latest drawing files in the Vault that are not listed in the dialog box, but are listed in the project definition file. The .wdp file is versioned upon check in. |
|  | *.wdp not checked out* | Files used to support the project (such as \\*.wdl and \\*.wdt) do not appear in the Vault Check In dialog box since the project definition file is not being checked in. If the project file is not checked out, upon a Project Check In All command, the project definition file is *not* versioned. The drawing files are added to the vault but are not associated to a project definition file. You have to check out the project definition file and check it back in to version up the project and make the association to the latest versions of the drawing files in the vault. |
| *Project Check In* | Adds only the project definition file into the vault. The project file is associated to all of the latest version drawings in the vault. | |
| *Project Check In* | If the project file is checked out and new drawing files are not checked in, the drawing files are checked in along with the project file to establish an association between the two files. | |

#### Using the AutoCAD Vault ARX

# Using the AutoCAD Vault ARX

Learn about the best practice workflow for using the AutoCAD ARX application.

You can access the vault commands from the File menu and from the Vault toolbar. From the command line you can execute check in, check out, undo check out, log in, and log out.

Note: Vaulting commands are not supported in SDI (Single Document) mode. The SDI system variable must be set to '0' for vaulting commands to be supported.

1. Before installing AutoCAD Vault ARX, determine the installation setup best suited for your company. Installing on a system that is too small can limit functionality or require reconfiguration in the future.
2. Install and configure Autodesk Vault server components in the server console. The administrator must create a user account for each person who needs access to the vault. A user account consists of a login name and password. Refer to the help in the server console for more information.
3. Log into the vault.
4. In AutoCAD or AutoCAD Mechanical open a file you want to add to the vault. In AutoCAD Electrical, you can also open the project you want to add to the vault.
5. Use the Check In command within the AutoCAD Vault ARX to add files to the vault for the first time. When you add a Host file that references other files, all dependent files are added automatically to the vault. Always add DWG and image files using the AutoCAD Vault ARX to maintain parent-child relationships between the files. Use Autodesk Vault to add all other files types.

   You can alternately use Check In All in AutoCAD Electrical to check in the project file and its drawing dependencies. AutoCAD Electrical creates a list of dependencies based on the project drawing list and provides it to the vault for group check in. The drawing files, project file, and non-drawing dependencies are copied into the vault working folder.

   Note: In AutoCAD Electrical, the non-drawing dependents (\*.wdl and \*.wdt) are added automatically when the project file (\*.wdp) is uploaded to the vault with the correct relationship to the project file itself.
6. The vault server now contains the master files. Although the files were not removed from your local working folder, they are now in a checked-in state. This means that the files in your working folder are now read-only and must be checked out to edit them.
7. All users who have access to the vault can now access the files. Use the Open from Vault or Check Out command to check out a file to your local disk for editing.
8. When you finish working on a file, use the Check In or Check In All command to check the file back into the vault so others can see the changes and edit it.

### Inventor Vault Add-in

# Inventor Vault Add-in

Learn about the Inventor Vault Add-in.

Autodesk Vault manages all your engineering files, regardless of the file type. Files can be Autodesk Inventor, AutoCAD, FEA, CAM, Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, or any other file used in the design process. You can organize all your files and keep them in one location for easy access. All file versions are retained, so you never misplace or replace past versions. The vault stores each version of a file, along with all the files dependencies, giving you a living history of the project as you work on it. The vault also stores file properties such as the user name, date, and comments for rapid searching and retrieving.

In a design team, all the files and associated data are stored on the server so all users have access to the information and its history. Each member of a team must have a unique login name and password. Team members check out files to prevent more than one member from editing the same file at the same time. Once a file is checked back into the vault, team members can refresh their local copies of the model file to get the latest version from the vault, so all members of the design team work together.

Autodesk Vault integrates with Autodesk Inventor software using an Autodesk Inventor add-in. The Autodesk Inventor add-in brings the basic file management functionality of Autodesk Vault into the Autodesk Inventor environment. Using Autodesk Vault with Autodesk Inventor, you can store and manage all your Autodesk Inventor files, including:

* Factories
* Assemblies
* Drawings
* Parts
* Presentations
* Project files
* Linked documents

When all your Autodesk Inventor files are stored in the vault, you ensure more accurate where-used information, comprehensive searching on all files, and better knowledge of what is the latest version of your designs.

**Organizing Files**

When working with Autodesk Vault, it is important to understand that the way you currently have your files organized may not be suited for a vaulted environment.

The very nature of a data management system requires that some planning be done to optimize file access and organization. We recommend all users not familiar with data management solutions to contact their Autodesk Authorized Reseller or Autodesk Professional Services for additional advice

#### About Autodesk Inventor Project Files

# About Autodesk Inventor Project Files

Autodesk Inventor provides a multi-user project type for use with the vault.

Note: Inventor LT does not support project files.

To get started in working with the vault, you can use [Autodesk Autoloader](GUID-EA9B2552-30B9-4789-9A5E-6580B8648981.htm) to create the vault project. Autodesk Autoloader uploads an entire Autodesk Inventor project to a vault located on an Autodesk data management server. The vault project file:

1. Logically structures data into logical projects or products that you design.
2. Formats search paths in a way that is acceptable for use with the vault.
3. Stores the location in the vault where the project data is stored:

This vault project must be used any time you want to work with the vault.

To access Autodesk Autoloader: Start > Programs > Autodesk > Autodesk Data Management > Tools > Autodesk Autoloader. Learn more about Autodesk Autoloader by clicking on Help.

#### Autodesk Inventor Project Rules for Autodesk Vault

# Autodesk Inventor Project Rules for Autodesk Vault

All Autodesk Inventor designs, including vault projects, require a project file to resolve file references. A project file contains search paths that are used to resolve links to referenced documents in the design.

Note: Inventor LT does not support project files.

The vault project file type must be used for all vault projects. A vault project file has some important restrictions that must be considered when preparing a design for the vault and require different rules than typical project files do.

The vault project settings help ensure that you have your data organized in a way that is suitable for use with the vault.

## Vault Project Rules

1. You must have a relative workspace. All projects must have a workspace defined that is set to either "." (the same folder as your project file) or to a subfolder underneath that, such as, \Workspace. You can have as many subfolders under your workspace as needed for organizational purposes, however, you cannot map a search path to them.
2. Local and workgroup search paths are not allowed. To keep data organized within a single folder structure, project files prevent you from creating these paths.
3. Library search paths are allowed. You can have library search paths located anywhere on your network or your local computer. For more information, see the section about Libraries.
4. Included files are not allowed. The vault project file does not allow them since local or workgroup paths can be added to an included file.
5. Relative paths must be set to true. Absolute paths cannot be used.

When any of these rules are broken, the project file automatically changes its multi-user settings from Vault to Off.

## Preparing an Existing Project

The steps to prepare an existing project for inclusion in the vault are similar, regardless of the current working environment (isolated, semi-isolated, or shared).

Assign a designated team member to vault the project, and use the following workflow:

* For semi-isolated and shared projects, ensure that all documents are checked in and all users have closed all Autodesk Inventor documents.
* For semi-isolated and shared projects, move all nonlibrary documents to a local drive. This ensures that no one can access the documents until they are in the vault. Retain the same folder structure on the local drive.
* Edit the project file search paths to point to the local folders. Open the top-level documents and resolve any link errors.

#### About Creating Projects for the Vault

# About Creating Projects for the Vault

When you are ready to create a design that you eventually vault, you must create a project file for it.

To take full advantage of Autodesk Vault, your project file must be configured properly. Autodesk Vault can manage only vault-enabled project files. A project file that was configured for use with Autodesk Vault contains additional settings including the name and location of the vault and the Multi-User setting must be set to Vault. When starting a new Autodesk Inventor model, create the vault-enabled project file before creating any model files.

The key difference in a vault project file is that local and workgroup search paths are not allowed. Consolidate all project folders under the single workspace search path for the project. The workspace is the local folder mapped to the corresponding folder in the vault. The workspace can be a single folder, or can include a hierarchy of subfolders to help organize the project.

Autodesk recommends that you use Autodesk Autoloader to create the vault project. Autodesk Autoloader uploads an entire Autodesk Inventor project to a vault located on an Autodesk data management server.

#### About Modifying Autodesk Inventor Projects

# About Modifying Autodesk Inventor Projects

All Autodesk Inventor project types can be modified to become vault projects.

Note: Inventor LT does not support project files.

The general process for getting legacy (existing) Autodesk Inventor data into the vault is to consolidate the Autodesk Inventor design files and the associated .ipj file so that it appears to be a single-user project with references only to libraries. File organization is the key factor when vaulting existing projects.

When working with Autodesk Inventor project, you must have all related data to a particular project within a single project file. If you have more than one logical project under a single project file, break them apart. For example, if your company makes two different computers (computer-a-and-computer-b), you must have two Autodesk Inventor project files, one for each. You can use common parts and library parts, and share and reuse these files between the two designs.

#### Modify an Autodesk Inventor Project

# Modify an Autodesk Inventor Project

Modify Inventor Projects using Autodesk Autoloader or manually.

Autodesk recommends using Autodesk Autoloader to format project data for the vault. Before modifying data for use with the vault, make sure no one is working on the files and that one person is designated to modify the files. Once you add the files to the vault, use the vault to share the files with other users.

## Modify an Autodesk Inventor Project Using Autodesk Autoloader

1. Click Start > Programs > Autodesk > Autodesk Data Management > Tools > Autodesk Autoloader.
2. Browse to and select the folder containing the Inventor data you want to modify.

Click Help to learn more about Autodesk Autoloader.

## Modify an Autodesk Inventor Project Manually

An alternate way to modify an existing project file is to rearrange the folder and files manually. The method is a little more difficult than working with Autodesk Autoloader, but you can organize your data the way you want it.

Note: When modifying project files manually, files may fail to resolve and you will need to find the missing references.

1. Make sure there are no users currently working on the data set or project you want to modify. We also recommend that the project data is moved to a local folder for editing to prevent any users from working on the project while you are modifying it.
2. Open the existing project file with either the stand-alone project file editor or Autodesk Inventor.
3. Add a workspace to your project file if you do not already have one. The workspace must either be set to "." (for example, the same folder as the project file) or it must be set to a subfolder relative to the project file (for example, ".\Workspace"). If you plan on having any of your library data local, set your workspace to a relative folder (for example, .\Workspace)
4. Remove all local and workgroup search paths.
5. After the search paths are removed, move all folders and files that were referenced from the search paths into the workspace. You can either maintain the same structure as you had originally or you can create a new one. Take care in deciding how to structure the files and folders. They are added to the vault with the same structure.

   Note: In most cases, you end up with files that fail to open because of moving these files. To successfully get these files into the vault successfully, resolve the failed references.
6. All libraries may stay the way they are. Any valid library search path is acceptable to the vault.
7. Open your files in Autodesk Inventor to resolve any failed references.

#### Map Vault Folders in Autodesk Inventor

# Map Vault Folders in Autodesk Inventor

The Autodesk Inventor project file contains folder paths need to be associated with corresponding folders in the vault.

Note: This feature is disabled for the Inventor LT Vault Add-in.

Associating with corresponding folders ensures that the proper project structure is maintained when you check Autodesk Inventor files in and out of the vault. When you map a folder in Autodesk Inventor to a vault folder, you are specifying where files are located in the vault relative to where they are located on the physical disk.

Autodesk recommends using Autodesk Autoloader to automate this process; alternatively, you can manually map folders using the Map Folders dialog box.

## Map Vault Folders with Autodesk Autoloader

1. Click Start > Programs > Autodesk > Autodesk Data Management > Tools > Autodesk Autoloader.
2. Browse to and select the folder containing the Inventor data you want to map.

Click Help to learn more about Autodesk Autoloader.

## Map Vault Folders Using the Map Folders Dialog

Use the Map Folders dialog to manually specify where the Autodesk Inventor Vault files are stored. The information is saved in the Autodesk Inventor project file for use by other users.

Vaulted libraries are mapped to a project in much the same way as workspace folders. The difference is that the Library check box must be turned on when creating a library folder. Library folders can only be created directly off the root level of the vault.

Vaulted Design Data and Template are mapped to an Inventor project. This helps in managing different versions of the design data and templates as they are modified by the administrator or CAD manager.

Note: You must be assigned the role of either Editor or Administrator to perform this action. Contact your vault administrator to verify your role.

### To Manually Map the Project in Autodesk Inventor

1. Open an Autodesk Inventor project.
2. Log into the vault.
3. Select the drop-down arrow from the Access group on the Autodesk Vault ribbon in Inventor, and then select Map Folders.
4. In the Project Folder Mapping dialog, select Project Root. Click Edit to create a mapping between the local project file and its intended location in the Vault.
5. Select an existing vault folder or create a folder in the vault.

   Note: As a best practice, do not enforce unique file names if any files with duplicate names are stored in the folder. When you are attempting to map the vault folder, the setting can be temporarily turned off to allow the mapping. See [Enforce Unique File Names](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-B95F67C8-7843-4435-B632-4996A97FFEA5) for more information.
6. Click OK to select the vault folder.
7. Repeat step 4-6 for the Content Center Files, Template, and Design Data.
8. Click OK to map the local folder to the selected vault folder.

Note: The project root, any libraries, design data, and template in use must be mapped to vault folders before adding files to the vault using either Check In or Check in Project in the Autodesk Inventor add-in.

### To Create a Folder in the Vault

1. In the Browse Vault for Folder dialog box, click New Folder. The Create folder in: $ dialog is displayed.
2. Enter a name for the folder.
3. To create a library folder, select the Library check box.
4. Click OK.

Note: Library folders can only be created directly off the root level of the vault.

### To Browse the Workspace in Autodesk Inventor

You can browse the workspace containing the current model in Autodesk Inventor.

* Select the drop-down arrow from the Access group on the Autodesk Vault ribbon, and then select Go to Workspace.

#### Sharing Project Files Using Autodesk Vault

# Sharing Project Files Using Autodesk Vault

All users who plan on working with a particular design should share or use the same Autodesk Inventor project file.

Note: Inventor LT does not support project files.

It is important to understand how projects are used when working with the vault. When working on a specific design, which is defined by an Autodesk Inventor Project File, you have only one Autodesk Inventor project file. By sharing the project file, all users are guaranteed to have the correct server, database, and project mappings. This practice minimizes end-user configuration requirements, and ensures that designs are structured in a consistent manner. If users attempt to create their own Autodesk Inventor project file, the vault cannot guarantee that the files are added or resolved to the correct location.

### Share an Autodesk Inventor Project File

1. After all files (designs) are added to the vault, including the project file, other users can access those files through the vault. Add these files to the vault from within Autodesk Inventor.
2. Using Autodesk Vault, each user browses to the project file in the vault and gets a copy of it into their working folder. At this time, the user uses the Get Latest Version command to copy the files to the local working folder. See Get Latest Version for more information.
3. Once users have copies of their designs in their working folder, they can use Autodesk Inventor or Autodesk Vault to check out files that need editing. See Check In, Check Out, and Undo Check Out for more information on these commands.

Using this method, all users can access project files and design data in a protected and collaborative environment.

#### File Numbering in Inventor

# File Numbering in Inventor

Automatic file numbering allows you to more easily organize your files with systematic naming schemes.

When you are logged into a vault and enact the Save As function for a file, you can have the system automatically append a set of predefined characters to the file name based on the scheme configured in the Autodesk Vault client. This feature allows you to enforce file naming conventions and prevents duplicate file names from being created.

You can generate a file number for a single file or multiple files.

The default scheme is Sequential. Use this scheme to number files sequentially. Other numbering schemes can be designed in the Autodesk Vault client. See the Autodesk Vault client help for more information.

## Generate Number for Multiple Files

Several Inventor commands create multiple files (e.g., Create Substitute). Some of these files are assigned a name by the Inventor software. When you first save these files, they are saved as a group. The Automatic file numbering feature allows you to override any existing names and select which scheme to use for which file. You may also select a single scheme to apply to all files in the group.

Generate Multiple File Names is supported for these Inventor features.

* Create Substitute
* Beam Calculator
* Shaft
* Spur Gear
* Disc Cam
* V-Belts
* Key
* Bearing
* Compression: Extension/Belleville/Torsion
* O-Ring
* Drum Break Calculator
* Separated Hub Joint Calculator
* Power Screw Calculator

#### Introduction to Data Cards

# Introduction to Data Cards

View pertinent Vault details and manage file properties with Data Cards.

The Data Cards feature provides convenient summaries of the metadata assigned to a file or group of files through a single point of access. With data cards, you can determine a file's vault status, see a thumbnail of the file, and review and modify property information without leaving the Inventor application.

![](../images/data-cards-homeview.png)

Whenever a part is selected on the CAD canvas or in the Model or Vault browser list, the part is highlighted on the canvas, in the list, and the data card automatically updates to show the relevant information for that part.

Note: If you select multiple parts in the browser list, the corresponding parts are selected on the CAD canvas but the data card is not updated. Refer to the topic on Working with Card Decks for more information on updating multiple data cards.

Similarly, if a data card is selected in a card deck, the part is selected on the CAD canvas and in the Model or Vault browser list.

#### Card Decks

Data cards can be displayed as an individual card or grouped together into a card deck for faster referencing of multiple files. Data cards also have two views: a fingertip view and a full data card view.

#### Data Card Administration

Administrators can configure the data card layout by determining how many pages a data card uses and which properties are displayed for a customized management experience. The [Configure Data Card](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-5DACC153-289B-401F-A103-9DD08E0995D0) dialog is accessed through the Behaviors tab on the Vault Settings dialog in the Autodesk Vault client.

#### Data Card Access

The data card feature can easily be turned on and off by selecting Data Cards from the Vault ribbon.

#### Enable Data Cards

The Data Cards feature can be toggled on and off, depending on your needs.

* Click the Data Cards button on the Autodesk Vault ribbon. The data card for the selected file is displayed in fingertip view.

##### Viewing Data Cards

# Viewing Data Cards

Data cards can be displayed in two different ways: the fingertip view and the full data card view.

Common vault commands can be accessed from any of the data card views using a context menu. You can quickly refresh from vault, get a revision, check in, check out, undo check out, revise, or change state without ever having to switch back to the vault browser or access the vault ribbon.

## Fingertip View

The fingertip view is the default view for Data Cards. This view is a collapsed, read-only version of the full data card. When a file is selected and the data card feature enabled, the fingertip displays the:

* Component name
* Vault status
* State
* Category
* Revision
* Thumbnail

### View Fingertip Information

1. Enable data cards by click the Data Card button on the Autodesk Vault ribbon.

   The data card window displays.
2. Select a part in the model.

   The data card grid updates automatically to show the part's file name, a thumbnail, revision, state, category, and vault status.

## Full Data Card View

The fingertip can be expanded into a full data card which displays all of the information in the fingertip view as well as certain property information. The CAD administrator can determine which properties are displayed on the Configure Data Card dialog, which can be accessed through the Vault Settings dialog in the Autodesk Vault client.

The tasks you can perform with the data card depend on whether the data card is in read-only mode or edit mode.

### Read-only mode

The read-only mode is the default mode for viewing the full data card. This mode allows you to compare selected files and to filter the property values based on your needs.

When a data card opens for a selected file or when a Refresh command is performed, the values for the properties are grabbed from the server and displayed. A pending icon displays next to the property name when the retrieval is in process. The pending icon disappears once the value is received for that property.

### Edit mode

The property grid can be changed to edit mode by clicking the Edit Button. When in edit mode, the file is automatically checked out of the vault and you can edit the displayed property values. When you are finished editing, the new values are written to the local file and to the server file. These edits are made permanent when the file is checked into the vault. All actions performed on an individual card affect only the component associated with the card.

### View Full Data Card Information

1. Click the >> button in the lower right-hand corner of the data card to switch between the fingertip view and the full data card view.

   The data card expands to display the properties. Some properties will show a pending icon until the value is retrieved from the server.
2. Click the tabs at the bottom of the grid to see additional properties.

   Note: Property information on additional tabs is determined by the CAD administrator on the Configure Data Card dialog in the Vault client.

##### Working with Data Card Decks

# Working with Data Card Decks

Multiple data cards can be retrieved to create a card deck. You can specify the scope of the card deck by selecting individual files or an entire open model.

A card deck contains one data card for each file specified in the scope and a Home card which lists the data cards in the card deck.

## Data Card Deck Controls

At the top of the card deck, a toolbar has been provided for navigating and managing the data cards in the card deck. These commands allow you to retrieve the data cards for a model or a specified group of files and place them into a deck, refresh the data card values, remove a card from the deck, isolate a card from the deck, and move a card to the front of the deck. There are also navigation buttons that allow you to move through the deck to the data card you want to review.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *Icon* | *Command* | *Definition* |
|  | Get Data Cards (Get CAD Files or Get Entire Model) | Retrieves either the selected CAD files or all the files in the open model and creates a card deck. Whichever Get Data Cards command is used last remains visible. |
|  | Refresh | If a single data card is displayed, the property values for that card are retrieved from the server.  If the Summary card is selected, the property values for all data cards defined by the current Get command are retrieved from the server. |
|  | Remove Card | Removes the current card or selected cards from the deck. |
|  | Isolate On | Turns on Isolation mode for the selected card or cards. Only the files for the selected data cards remain visible and all other files in the card deck are rendered transparent on the canvas. |
|  | Isolate Off | Turns off Isolation mode for the selected card or cards. All files which were transparent when Isolate was turned on are visible again. |
|  | Select in Inventor | Sends the current card selection to the Inventor environment as a selection set. |
|  | Clear Inventor Selection | Clears the current Inventor selection set. |
|  | First | Goes to the first card in the card deck (also referred to as the Home card). |
|  | Back | Goes back one card in the deck. |
|  | Home | Goes to the Home card. |
|  | Next | Goes to the next card in the deck. |
|  | Last | Goes to the last card in the deck. |

## The Home Card

The home card displays a list of the files in the card deck and their property attributes. The property values that are displayed depend on whether a single data card, multiple data cards, or no data cards are selected from the data card list.

* If a single data card is selected, then the property values for that data card are displayed on the home card.
* If multiple data cards are selected, then the property values shared across the selected data cards are displayed. If the values differ, then the word VARIES appears.
* If no data cards are selected in the data card list, then all the property values shared across the entire deck are displayed. If the values differ, then the word VARIES appears.

![](../images/data-cards-homeview.png)

You can make edits with individual data cards or use the Home card to make bulk edits throughout the entire card deck. When making bulk edits for properties with different values throughout the deck, a value collector is used to list the different values associated with that property.

At the top of the home card, the number of cards in the deck and the number of cards selected for comparison are displayed.

### Isolation Mode

Sometimes in models with many parts it can be necessary to isolate a part for easier examination. The isolation feature allows you to distinguish specified parts in a model. Select the data card(s) for the part(s) which you want to view and click Isolate On from the data card deck controls. The selected parts remain visible on the CAD canvas while all other parts in the card deck become transparent.

Click the Isolate Off button on the data card deck controls to make all parts on the CAD canvas visible again.

### List Context Menu

A convenient list context menu allows you to access card deck commands and refresh data card properties. The context menu is accessed by right-clicking a data cards or selection of data cards in the home card list.

Note: Vault operations can only be performed when the data card is in read-only mode.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| *Command* | *Definition* |
| Refresh | Updates the data card properties with values retrieved from the server.  Note: The context menu is disabled when property values are being retrieved. |
| Remove Card | Removes the selected card(s) from the card deck. |
| Select All | Selects all cards in the card deck list. |
| Clear Selection | Unselects all cards in the card deck list. |
| Select in CAD | Selects on the CAD canvas all components which correspond to the selected data cards. |
| Clear CAD Selection | Unselects on the CAD canvas all components which correspond to the selected data cards. |

##### Editing Properties with Data Cards

# Editing Properties with Data Cards

Learn about editing file properties on a full data card and within a card deck.

Changes with data cards can only be made when the data card is in edit mode. Click the edit button to begin changing property values.

Files must be checked out before changing anything. If any files in the card deck are not checked out or if a data card is not available for editing, you will receive a message asking you to check out the files or to remove any invalid cards from the card deck. When a property is edited, click Save to commit the changes. An asterisk appears beside the file name to indicate that the data card has been modified.

Modified files must be checked back into the vault for the changes to become permanent. If you attempt to close the card deck or to change the data card view while a modified file is checked out, you will be prompted to check the file in or discard your changes before proceeding.

## Tracking Edits

Since edits are not immediately permanent, you can track edits and review them before checking the modified files into the vault. If a property has been modified, an asterisk (\*) appears beside the file name on the data card and beside the file names in the data list on the home card if you are using a card deck.

Additionally, the font changes for property values that have been modified.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *Text* | *Meaning* | *Edit* |
| Normal font | Same as original value (no change) | The value is the same as the original value or has been reset before checking the file back in. |
| Normal font with gray background | read-only | The file cannot be altered even in Edit mode. |
| Strikethrough Font | Deleted Value | The original value was deleted. When the file is checked back into the vault, this value is blank. |
| Blue Font | Edited Value | The original value has changed but the file has not been checked back into the vault to commit the change. |

## Undoing Changes

During the editing process, you can choose to undo a single property change or to undo all changes as long as the current changes have not been committed.

Right-click on the data card to open a context menu. Select Revert to reset the selected property to its original value. Select Revert All to reset all properties to their original values.

**Compliance**

Compliance is a key component in managing properties. When a property is non-compliant, a red exclamation icon is inserted into the value field on the data card. On the home card, the icon appears beside the file name to let you know that one of the properties for that file is non-compliant.

Hover your mouse over the icon to see a tooltip describing the reason why the property is not compliant. Since some data cards contain multiple tabs of properties, the icon will also appear on the tab to indicate if there is a non-compliant property not visible on the data card.

You can edit properties for a single data card or multiple data cards at once.

##### Working with Data Card Value Collectors

# Working with Data Card Value Collectors

The value collector is a dialog which lists the different values associated with a particular property in a card deck. The values listed are collected from the data cards selected on the home card or the entire deck if no cards are selected.

The value collector contains a Value column with the list of property values and a Usage column which displays how many data cards share that particular value.

Value collectors can be accessed from the home card or from a single data card.

## Using a Value Collector with the Home Card

In a card deck, the same properties are repeated for each card. If a selection of data cards share the same value for that property, then that value is displayed next to the property name on the home card. However, if the property values differ, then the word VARIES appears next to the property. Properties with a value of VARIES are displayed with a small ellipses ![](../images/icon-ellipses.png) icon. Click the icon to access the value collector.

You can filter property values for review in read-only mode or change them in edit mode.

### Read-only Mode

In read-only mode, you can filter values collected. Select a value in the value collector and click Filter to select the cards in the card list that contain that property value.

For example, the value collector for the Creation Date property lists all of the values for Creation Date in the deck. If you select January 31, 2008 from the collector and click OK, the five cards with January 31, 2008 as the value for Creation Date are selected in the card list.

This process can be repeated for additional properties, allowing you to refine the data card selection each time.

Click Cancel to close the dialog.

### Edit Mode

Note: The file associated with a data card must be checked out before editing any properties.

In edit mode, you can change the values for a file associated with a particular data card or make bulk changes to all cards associated with that value.

The value collector has both a Values and Usage column. However, unlike read-only mode, an editing field at the top of the value collector allows you to adjust values for the data cards that use that property.

For example, the value collector for Creation Date property lists all of the values for Creation Date in the deck. If you select January 31, 2008, in the collector, January 31, 2008 is displayed for editing at the top of the dialog. The value can then be cleared or modified. Click Save to commit any changes.

## Using a Value Collector with a Single Data Card

On a single data card, the properties are the same as those on every other card in the deck. However, only the property values for the selected data card are displayed. A small ellipses icon ![](../images/icon-ellipses.png) is displayed next to each property. Click the icon to access the value collector.

### Read-only Mode

In read-only mode, the value collector displays a list of available values in the card deck. These values do not impact the card.

### Edit Mode

In edit mode, the value collector displays a list of available values in the card deck. A value can be selected from the list and applied to the file associated with the current data card.

## Work with Value Collectors

Value collectors list the different values associated with a particular property in the card deck. Use value collectors to filter property values for review in read-only mode or change them in edit mode.

#### Learn About Data Mapping

# Learn About Data Mapping

The Data Mapping feature allows you to easily assess important business data for your model. Report data is mapped on to the model to provide visual output of the correlation between report results and the open model.

Mapping the report to the model colors the model to match the corresponding chart elements. The entire chart can be mapped onto the model, or you can choose which chart elements to map.

![](../images/data-mapping-main.png)

The chart displayed in the report control summarizes the actual values for the open model. However, the data mapped to the model may show different results, depending on the level of the model hierarchy included. You can specify the level at which the data mapping is applied from three options:

* First level children
* All assemblies (the value mapped to the lowest level assembly will take precedence over all others)
* Leaf node

Note: Data Mapping is not available in sketch mode.

##### Data Mapping Rules

# Data Mapping Rules

Data Mapping rules help you understand how data is gathered and displayed.

Data mapping is a useful tool for viewing different levels of data in a model. Because the model hierarchy can be mapped at different levels, it is important to know from where the data is being collected to accurately interpret the results.

Additionally, you should also know how file attachments affect the report results.

## File Attachments

A report is generated using all of the files in the current model, including attachments. As a result, the chart may not have a 1:1 correlation with the files displayed in the canvas.

For example, a pie chart slice may indicate that a large percentage of files is currently in the Work in Progress (WIP) state. However, when mapping the data onto the model, only a small number of files are color coded to the wip slice. This difference in display is because the slice is taking into account the attached files as well as the part files but only the part files are visible on canvas. You can view the full report to see a complete list of files that make up a pie slice.

## Mapping Report Data to the Model Hierarchy

When a report is generated, the reporting system evaluates the files without knowledge of their relationships. The resulting chart represents actual flat data. Since a model has several levels to it, you have the option of mapping your data as three different levels to better understand the report data. This versatility allows you to examine model data at the parts level, the assemblies level, and the first children level. By examining all three levels, you will have the most complete picture of the report results.

## Leaf Node Mapping

Leaf Node mapping is the most granular view of the model. Only parts within assemblies are mapped. This level is used most often early in a project to see where components are in the development process.

## All Assemblies Mapping

All Assemblies mapping provides a perspective of the report results as they relate to the assembly level and first level parts. The color of an assembly determines the color of its parts but subassemblies are assigned their own colors.

## First Level Children Mapping

First level children mapping is the least granular view. All parts and assemblies within each first level child are given the same color as the first level child.

Note: Data Mapping is not available in sketch mode.

##### Data Mapping Reports

# Data Mapping Reports

The reporting feature, when used in conjunction with data mapping, lets you map report data to the canvas for visual overview of a model's status and development.

![](../images/report-exampleofdatamappingreport.png)

This information makes it easier to track designs and projects throughout their lifecycles. You can generate reports of model data based on any of the templates supplied with the client. The report feature is accessed from the Data Mapping dialog.

## Report Templates

Report templates are provided with the Autodesk Vault client. These report templates contain a color palette for a chart, but the templates do not specify which color is assigned to which chart element. You can specify how chart elements are color coded when you use the data mapping feature. Color coding chart elements allows quick, repeatable viewing of model data.

You can assign standard color mapping on the [Assign Color](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-53ACB5F6-B6AA-4EFC-8223-1D0F9E1F249C) dialog in the Autodesk Vault client. Access the dialog by selecting Tools ► Administration ► Vault Settings. Select the Behaviors tab and then click Define under Report Management.

![](../images/dialog-assign-color.png)

## Report Types

The report feature can display data in four different charts:

* Pie chart
* Doughnut chart
* Column chart
* Stacked column chart

Note: If a report contains a chart type not supported by the in-CAD report control, the chart is not displayed on the CAD canvas. The report can be viewed outside the application with a report viewer.

##### Manage Chart Elements

# Manage Chart Elements

Customize how your report data is displayed by manipulating chart elements.

The chart control allows you to override chart colors, create a selection set of files in Inventor based on chart elements and mapped components, and retrieve a data card deck for the mapped components through a convenient context menu.

Note: The Data Mapping feature is available only in Autodesk Vault Collaboration and Professional editions.

## Select Chart Elements

When you map report data, all chart elements are mapped to the model by default. However, you can select individual chart elements in the report and map only those elements. Additionally, you can manipulate the way the data is displayed on the open model.

There are three ways to select chart elements. Once the chart elements are selected, use the context menu to customize how the data is mapped or viewed.

* Click a single element in the chart to select it. The element is outlined in red.
* Hold the Control button and click multiple chart elements to select multiple chart elements and act on those elements using the context menu.
* Double-click different chart elements to separate them from the chart. When Map Data is turned on or the data mapping is refreshed, only the separated pieces are mapped on the model.

Once a selection is made, click Clear Color Mapping or Isolation to update the data mapping or to update the isolation.

Note: Changes to element selection and color overrides are not mapped onto the model until you update the mapping.

## Context Menu Options

A context menu provides additional options for manipulating mapped data and customizing the view.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| *Command* | *Definition* |
| Override Color | Allows you to specify a different color for a chart element. |
| Reset | Removes a color override. |
| Selection Set | Creates a selection set from the components corresponding to the selected chart elements. The corresponding components are selected in the browser as well as the canvas. |

##### Map Report Data Dialog

# Map Report Data Dialog

The Map Report Data dialog contains several features which allow you to generate reports, map report results, and manage chart elements.

The Map Report Data dialog turns opaque when the mouse moves over it and transparent when the mouse moves away. The chart legend can be toggled on or off to further reduce the size of the dialog and conserve canvas space.

Since the Map Report Data dialog is document-based, each document can have its own dialog.

## Enabling Data Mapping

Data Mapping must be enabled for the Map Report Data dialog to be displayed. Enable data mapping by clicking Map Data on the Autodesk Vault ribbon. When the Map Report Data dialog first opens, only the Report Template drop-down menu and the Generate Report button are enabled. All other controls are disabled until a report is generated.

## Map Report Data Dialog Features

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Report Template drop-down menu | The report template drop-down list contains a list of the most recently used templates and the options for opening an existing template from either a local folder or the vault.  *Note:* Opening a template from the vault checks that file out of the vault. The file is checked in after it is saved. |
| Generate Report button | Creates a report based on the selected template. Click the button again to refresh report results after making changes. |
| Display Options button | Allows you to enable or disable chart labels and the chart legend. |
| View Full Report button | Displays the full report in a report viewer. |
| Mapping Method drop-down menu | Allows you to select which of the three mapping methods to use when mapping chart data or isolating files. The three options are: leaf nodes, all assemblies, and first level children. |
| Map Data button | Assigns the chart element colors to the corresponding model components based on the selected mapping method.  This button is a toggle and can be clicked again to turn off color assignments. |
| Isolate button | Dims the files that are not represented by the chart elements and leaves the selected chart data mapped on the screen at full visibility. The data is isolated based on the current mapping method.  This button is a toggle and can be clicked again to turn off isolation and restore all files to full visibility. |
| Clear Color Mapping or Isolation button | Updates the current mapping and isolation display if any changes are made to the chart element selection.  *Note:* If new data is added to the vault, the report must be regenerated. This button does not re-run the report. |
| Chart Selector | Allows you to select which chart to use for data mapping if more than one chart exists for the template.  If data is currently mapped when a new chart is selected, the data is cleared. Click Map Data to map the data from the new chart. |
| Chart element context menu | Allows you to select and manage chart elements for custom data mapping.  By default, all chart elements are mapped to the model. |
| Chart Legend | Displays the chart elements and associated color assignments in a colorful graph. |

#### Using Autodesk Inventor Libraries

# Using Autodesk Inventor Libraries

Library files are files that are commonly used across multiple designs, such as instances, fasteners, electrical components, and pneumatic components. These library files can be stored in a vault.

A special icon indicates a library folder in the vault: ![](../images/icon-library.gif)

## What Files Should I Consider Library Files?

Library files typically have a few characteristics that make them library files.

* Library files are static in nature.
* Library files are reused often and in many different designs.
* Library files are standard within an organization. It is desirable to make them readily available.
* Libraries of files are typically large in size, sometimes containing thousands of library parts and assemblies and gigabytes of data.

Note: Content center files are treated just like standard library files. By default, Autodesk Inventor creates a library path for content center files.

## Library Folder Rules

1. Library folders must be located directly from the root of the vault ($)
2. Normal folders cannot be located or created under a library folder.
3. Library folders cannot be located under a normal folder.
4. Files within a library folder cannot be shared to another folder. They can only be moved from folder to folder.
5. Once a folder is created as a library folder, it cannot be changed to a normal folder and vice-versa. If you want to change the folder type you must create a folder of the opposite type and manually move all the files from first folder to the new folder.
6. When you retrieve latest versions of files with their dependencies, and one or more of the dependencies is located within a library folder, the vault ignores the file for that operation.
7. When using the Get Previous Version command on a file that has a child dependency to a library file, the library structure is created parallel to the workspace so you can open the previous version of the file.

Note: This is done to prevent the shared folder of data from being changed while other users are working on the files. Changing a library file can affect many designs and requires coordination with members of the team also using that file.

## Map Autodesk Inventor Libraries

To work on Autodesk Inventor files that are stored in the vault, log into the vault database. If a vault was not set up, contact your vault administrator.

1. From the folder list, select a folder in the vault.
2. Click OK. The selected vault folder is mapped to the project when you click OK in the Project Folder Mapping dialog box.

Note: It is recommended you use Autoloader to add library search paths.Autodesk Autoloader automates this process. To access Autoloader: Start > Programs > Autodesk > Autodesk Data Management > Tools > Autodesk Autoloader. Learn more about Autodesk Autoloader by clicking on Help.

## Create a Library on Your Network

If you have data that fits within what is considered a library, set up these files on your network. Perform the following steps to get a library set up within Autodesk Inventor.

1. Create a shared folder on a network server where you plan to store the library data. Assign an appropriate name such as Library.
2. Make sure that all Vault users have the appropriate read-only or greater access to this folder and all of its contents.
3. Create a series of subfolders underneath the new folder for organizing your content. As the contents is added to the Vault, these subfolders are replicated.
4. Add any files to the folder that are considered Library files.
5. Make sure that other users do not have their own copies of these files being used in designs. It is important to start with a clean, single copy of these files.

## Add a Search Path to Your Autodesk Inventor Project File

To use the new Library you created, add a search path to your Autodesk Inventor Library files.

1. Open your Autodesk Inventor Project file either within Autodesk Inventor or within the Project File editor. If the project file is already in the vault, then check the file out first before attempting to change it.
2. Add a search path to your newly created folder as an Autodesk Inventor "Library Search Path" (local or workgroup search paths are not allowed.) Add this path as a UNC path or file:\\ComputerName\Library\. As a best practice do not add these paths to your Autodesk Inventor Project file as a mapped drive because other users share these settings and it is difficult to guarantee that all users mapped their drives properly.
3. Save the Project file and check in the changes into the vault.

## Vault Library Data

After you successfully create your shared library and modify your Autodesk Inventor project file you can now add (check-in) the library files to the vault. Adding a library file automatically takes place any time one of the library files is used by a parent assembly.

1. Open an Autodesk Inventor assembly, presentation, or drawing document that contains files within the library.
2. Log on to the appropriate vault.
3. Select the drop-down arrow from the Access group on the Autodesk Vault ribbon in Inventor, and then select Map Folders
4. Select the unmapped library listed in the dialog box and then click Edit. The Browse Vault for Folder dialog box is displayed.
5. Select the vault root, $, and then click New Folder and create a folder called "Library". Turn on the Library check box, and then click OK to create the library folder.

   Note: All Library folders must be located directly off the top-level folder ($).
6. Click OK to map the new library folder.
7. Proceed with vaulting your data using either check-in or Add Project. Notice that the files located within the library search path are added to the new Library project.

## Browse the Vault for a Folder

To work on Inventor files that are stored in the vault, log into the vault database. If a vault was not set up, contact your vault administrator.

1. From the folder list, select a folder in the vault.
2. Click Ok. The selected vault folder is mapped to the project when you click OK in the Project Folder Mapping dialog box.

#### Working with Model States and Vault Files

# Working with Model States and Vault Files

Model States are used to represent designs at different sizes, manufacturing stages, and simplification levels in a single part or assembly file.

## About Model States

Model States offer capabilities similar to those found in iParts/iAssemblies, however all configurations are stored in a single file instead of multiple files. This provides a convenient way to engineer, manage, and manufacture your designs with different dimensions, components, properties, or simplification levels. Each model state supports unique iProperties, Parameters, and Bill of Materials.

For more information, see the Inventor Help.

Note: Legacy Levels of Detail (LODs) are converted to Model States.

For more information, see About Level of Detail Migration in the [Inventor Help](https://www.autodesk.com/level-of-detail-migration-2025-help-enu).

Choose the desired model state to display when opening an Inventor assembly from a vault. Only files necessary to open the specified model state to the local workspace are downloaded. Components suppressed by the model state are not downloaded.

Not all Vault commands work with suppressed components. The following commands are not available in the Vault browser context menu when a suppressed file is selected. To use these commands, the files must first be unsuppressed.

* Check Out
* Undo Check Out
* Find in Window

Note: The Property Write-Back command is not available for suppressed files.

## Checking out files

A suppressed file cannot be checked out. A file that has suppressed children can be checked out; however, the suppressed children are not checked out. Suppressed components are not listed in the Check Out or Check In dialog boxes.

## Getting the latest version of files

Files suppressed by model state are not downloaded from the vault. When the files are loaded into Autodesk Inventor, the suppression rules are followed. The suppressed subassembly is displayed in the Vault browser using the strikethrough font, but the subassembly or its children are not loaded into Autodesk Inventor.

Note: Depending on how the managed prompts are configured, you may be prompted to verify that local files can be replaced when getting the latest version of files from the vault.

## Checking in files

Check-in command is not available on Components suppressed by the active model state in the Vault browser context menu. If a suppressed component requires check in you must change the active model state where the component is unsuppressed before check in.

Note: Suppressed components can be checked-in if the check-in action is initiated on an unsuppressed parent node.

## Checking in Factory Files

Members can be checked-in from factory files. Members using the default file name and path are supported for inclusion on check in. Members that are checked out or that do not reside in the vault at the time of check in must be checked-in from the Check in dialog.

Note: There are no dependency constraints when checking in member files from a factory.

### Undoing checked out files

The Undo Check Out operation can be performed on an assembly with suppressed children. However, the suppressed files are not listed in the Undo Check Out dialog box. The Replace local copy option does not apply to the suppressed files.

### Opening and placing files from the vault with suppressed children

When opening or placing a file from the vault, the same rules as getting the latest version applies to suppressed files. The latest versions of the specified file and all of its children are retrieved from the vault first and then the necessary files are checked out. The model state suppression is honored once the file is opened or placed in Autodesk Inventor.

**Adding files to the vault**

Suppressed files cannot be added (checked in) to a vault. If a file has one or more new children that are suppressed, the children must be unsuppressed before they can be added to the vault. These files must be unsuppressed before they can be added.

## Assembly File – Open/Place from Vault Options

When opening an Autodesk Inventor assembly, you can choose which model state to load. When a model state is specified we minimize file download of only unsuppressed components.

In the File Open Options dialog:

1. Select **Express** to open an assembly in express mode. Refer to the Inventor help for more information about express mode. Select **Full** to open the drawing and find/resolve all the referenced files.
2. Select the **Model State**.

   A Model State is typically a configuration, manufacturing state, or simplified component. "Primary" specifies the primary model state.

   Note: By default, the file opens with the last active model state. Edit the Inventor Application Options appearance settings to set the default file open option.
3. Select the Representation:

   * **Design View Representation**: Click the arrow to open the file with a specified Design View representation. Design Views affect several display attributes of the assembly, such as component visibility, color, enable status, browser state, sections, and camera orientation.
   * **Positional Representation**: Click the arrow to open the file with a specified Positional representation. Positional representations may include alternate constraint values, component positions, or other attributes that affect component positions.
4. To create an association between the selected file and the active file, select the **Associative** checkbox. You assign a Design View representation to a subassembly at any level in the assembly hierarchy and make it associative. Changes to the Design View are represented in higher-level assemblies that contain the subassembly.
5. Click OK.

## Drawing File – Open from Vault Options

Select Full to open the drawing and find/resolve all the referenced files.

Select Defer to open the drawing without finding or resolving any of the referenced files.

Note: In the File Open Options dialog, if you select Full and check the box for Skip all unresolved files, the drawing behaves as though it has been opened without any file references. Edits can be made and saved. However, annotations added in this state will be fixed the next time the drawing is opened with references available.

## Model State Associated Drawings

The Open Drawing command opens the associated drawing for the model state. Drawings are automatically attached to associated items. This command is available from both the Inventor model browser and Vault browser.

* **Single drawing associated to the model state**: If a single drawing is associated to the model state file, the drawing file opens directly from Vault.

  For instance, there is a part file with two or more model states with associated drawing (MS1 with drawing file D1 and MS2 with drawing file D2). In this case, if you select the Open Drawing command on MS1, the drawing file D1 will open. Similarly, if you select the Open drawing command on MS2, the drawing file D2 will open.
* **Multiple drawings associated to the model state**: If there are multiple drawings associated to the model state, you can select and open one or more of the associated drawings from the "Select File from Vault" dialog.

  For instance, there is a part file with the model state that includes multiple drawing files. In this case, upon selecting the Open Drawing command on the model state, the "Select File from Vault" dialog displays all the associated drawing files. You can select a drawing file from the list to open.
* **No associated drawings**: If there is no associated drawing to the model state, you can open related drawings from other model states.

  For instance, there is a part file with multiple model states (MS1, MS2, MS3), where MS2 has no associated drawing. In this case, upon selecting the Open Drawing command on MS2, you have the option to open the drawing file from other model states (MS1, MS2). If you proceed, the "Select File from Vault" dialog displays all the associated drawing files to other model states (MS1, MS2). Select a drawing file from the list to open.

## Assigning Item

* Model States with different part number:

  While assigning items to model states with different part numbers, the associated item is automatically created and assigned to each model state.
* Model States with the same part number:

  While assigning item to model states with the same part number, the system automatically assigns one item to all model states. The item then reflects the Primary model state.

  For non-primary model states with the same part number, the assigned item then reflects the first inline model state in the Inventor model browser. For example, there are four model states - Primary, MS1, MS2, and MS3, where MS2 and MS3 share the same part number. In this case, the item reflects the model state MS2 as the system picks the first model state with the same part number.

  Note: The initial item creation is based on display order in the Inventor browser. Item reordering is not supported when editing and updating properties.

After assigning the item to model state, you can change a model state to have a new part number and item by either creating a new model state, or deleting the existing item and then recreating the item.

Note: Vault doesn't restrict you to manage every model state with different part number or with the same part number. You can have some model states with the same part number, and some with different part number.

Note: If the BOM row setting has been set to "All" while configuring Item Assignment settings, all components used in the assembly will get items assigned upon selecting the Assign/Update item command for that assembly file.

## Update Properties

After assigning items to a model states enabled file, use the Update Properties command to keep file properties for all model states up to date in Inventor. All model states with the same part number are updated to reflect the same item properties.

While mapping date type item property to Inventor model state, you need to set one value for all items to avoid any difference between Inventor and Vault values.

See [Update Properties](GUID-11A427DB-701F-4C81-9EB2-F6E732EBBC11.htm) for more information.

**Property compliance/synchronization behavior**

Vault uses the Item assigned from the Primary model state to conduct a check on properties compliance and properties synchronization.

Note: The Vault CAD properties that are mapped to Autodesk Vault properties are updated to reflect any changes made in Autodesk Vault. Refer to the topic [Properties Administration](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-26645DD0-AC27-4CFB-BC15-41719B5DE609) for more information.

The following scenario explains the property compliance/synchronization behavior:

1. Create an Inventor file (Part1.ipt) with multiple model states (Part1, Part1-MS1, Part2-MS2) and check the file into Vault.
2. Create a user-defined property 'TestRevision' and select the property type 'Text'. For information on creating user-defined property, view the topic [Create a User-Defined Property](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-D80155DE-3558-4403-BBC0-CEF88B6DE178).
3. Map the Vault property Revision with entity type 'File' to the Inventor property 'TestRevision'. For information on property mapping, view the topic [Map Properties](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-915561C8-1143-4E68-BE41-37376FA39A58).
4. Map the Vault property Revision with entity type 'Item' to the Inventor property 'TestRevision'.
5. The object category is set to 'Base' and has no Revision assigned, by default.
6. Right-click the file and select Assign/Update Item. The item values are listed as follows:

   | Item | Name | Part Number | Assigned from File | Revision |
   | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
   | Part1 | Part1 | Part1 | part1.ipt | A |
   | Part1-MS1 | Part1(modelstate1) | Part1-MS1 | part1.ipt | A |
   | Part1-MS2 | Part1(Modelstate2) | Part1-MS2 | part1.ipt | A |
7. Select the File, click Change Category in the Vault ribbon, and change the category from 'Base' to 'Engineering'. You will see part1.ipt is in Revision A and displays properties compliance error in the Project Explorer.
8. Select the file and click Actions > Synchronize Properties. You will see that there are no changes to the part1.ipt file property. Part 1.ipt remains at Revision A even if you synchronize properties.
9. Now, change the Revision for Part1 item to A.1. Then, change the Revision for Part1-MS1 item to A.1.1, and for Part1-MS2 item to B.
10. Select the file and click Actions > Synchronize Properties.

    The Inventor property (custom property) will always synchronize with Part1 item (which is assigned from the Primary Model State) and thus, TestRevision will revise to Revision A.1 after synchronization. However, the file revision will remain Revision A.

    ![](../images/modelstates-synchronizeproperties-icon.png)

## Bill of Materials (BOM)

All model states with the same part number share the same BOM as the Primary model state. However, model states with different part number have different BOM.

The Bill of Materials (BOM) tab in the Inventor Show Details dialog allows you to manage BOM representations and filter the rows.

* If you select the model state component from Vault browser, the BOM tab displays the BOM information of the first created item.
* If you select the model state component from Inventor Model browser, the BOM tab displays the active model state BOM. If there is no item assigned to the model state, the BOM tab is blank.

## Data Standard Support

While copying the part or assembly file together with their associated drawing file, the Copy incl. Drawing command copies all the drawing files associated with all the model states.

## Copy Design

While working with the Copy Design feature, if there are model state files with different part number, then there is a limitation that some of the file properties for model states won't be copied. You can modify the affected properties after copying the files.

## DWF Attachment Options

While assigning item to change order, each model state inherits the visualization file (.dwf) attached to the Primary model state.

## Model State Properties

The Model State system properties help you to identify whether the file has an associated model state. You can use these properties for search and customize views where the value is true.

**Has Model State**

* True (Indicates that the Part/Assembly has an associated Model State file)
* False (Indicates that the Part/Assembly has no associated Model State file)
* Empty (Not applicable)

**Is True Model State**

* True when it is True Model State file (Indicates there is no Part Number column in the table)
* False when it is True Configuration file (Indicates there is Part Number column in the table)

Refer to the [Assigning Item](working-with-model-states-and.html#assigning-item) section for more information.

**Is Table Driven**

* True when it is either iComponent (iPart/iAssembly) or Model State file
* False for other Inventor files

#### Instance Properties and Vault

# Instance Properties and Vault

Learn how to display properties for individual component instances in Vault Client.

Instance properties are properties assigned to individual component instances that are stored in the parent assembly. For more information on Instance properties, see the Inventor Help.

## Working with Instance Properties in Vault Client

Instance Properties work the same way as Item Property occurrence within the Vault Bill of Materials (BOM). Items with the same part number are grouped by the instance property value.

Note: Ensure to configure the following settings.

* In the Configure Assign Item dialog, select "All" for rows that will be turned on during Assign Item.
* Select/Deselect "Group BOM rows as per the design BOM" option.

  + If only model view is enabled in Inventor design BOM, then

    - If "Group BOM rows as per the design BOM" option is checked, then in Vault Explorer assigned BOM view will show items split.
    - If "Group BOM rows as per the design BOM" option is unchecked, then in Vault Explorer assigned BOM view will show items grouped.
  + If Structure view is enabled in Inventor design BOM, then

    - If you check "Merge Instance Rows" option in the Inventor BOM view setting, then all instances are merged in the Inventor BOM Structure view. Vault Explorer assigned BOM view will always show item grouped and "Group BOM rows as per the design BOM" setting is ignored.
    - If you uncheck "Merge Instance Rows" option in the Inventor BOM view setting, then all instances are split in the Inventor BOM Structure view.

      * If "Group BOM rows as per the design BOM" option is checked, then in Vault Explorer assigned BOM view will show items split.
      * If "Group BOM rows as per the design BOM" option is unchecked, then in Vault Explorer assigned BOM view will show items grouped.

To display Instance Properties, you need to customize BOM row properties in the Vault and create new BOM row properties that map to file properties with Instance Properties values.

Once the file with Instance Properties is successfully checked into the Vault, perform the following steps:

* On the Toolbar menu, select Administration > Vault Settings.
* In the Vault Settings dialog, select the **Behaviors** tab.
* Click **Properties** to create a new BOM row property that maps to file properties to streamline your design management process. See [Create a Bill of Materials (BOM) Row Property Definition](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-E8EFF24A-E893-48E3-B6A3-88231D4ACA42) for details.
* Select the **Mapping** tab to map properties to a user-defined property. Mapping priority determines the order in which properties are written to a vault object. See [Map Properties](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-915561C8-1143-4E68-BE41-37376FA39A58) for details.
* Once a property definition is created, select the file with Instance Properties, right-click and select **Assign /Update Item** to display the Item dialog.
* Select the **Bill of Materials** tab and click on the Bill of Materials row.
* Right-click on the item, and then select **Customize View** to customize how your BOMs are displayed in the preview pane and the item record.
* On the Customize View dialog, click **Fields** to add newly created properties as the fields in the Bill of Materials. See [Customize the Bill of Materials (BOM) View](GUID-E926FCEE-9774-4329-BDCD-87BB537BFE17.htm) for details.
* Again, click the BOM row, right-click on the item and select **Turn Branch On**. The selected row and all its children are included in the BOM.
* Click **Save**.

#### Duplicate Search

# Duplicate Search

Duplicate Search helps you find duplicates based on shape search, and benefit you and your company by reducing engineering & downstream costs for documentation, simulation, tooling, and so on.

Using Duplicate Search functions you can:

As an engineering manager, in Vault Client:

* Configure Duplicate Search range (administrator and configuration administrator only).
* Identify the overall duplicate status in Vault within the specified range.
* View and export detailed reports about duplicate parts.

Duplicate Search is only available using Vault Professional.

As a CAD designer and a design lead, in Inventor:

* Find duplicate parts inside Vault for all part files within selected assembly.

  Note: You can only use Duplicate Search within Inventor Part and Assembly environments. See below what criteria we consider when searching for duplicates.
* Replace all instances of the selected duplicate part in the selected assembly.
* Place selected part from Search Results panel to the assembly.
* View details of the selected duplicate part, for example where it is used, when it was created.
* Open selected duplicate part from the Search Results panel in Inventor.

![](../images/ds-divider.png)

Duplicate Search is based on geometric properties of the Inventor part files, it only works for part files that do have solid body inside, below are cases of duplicates.

## Duplicate Search Definition

A part file is considered as duplicate if:

* The solid bodies in Inventor part files have exactly same geometry.
* The part file can contain multiple solid bodies.

Parameters that do not affect the mechanism during the search for duplicates:

* Other non-geometry parameters on solid body for example material, density, colour.

  ![](../images/ds-definition1.jpg)
* Different orientation of parts

  ![](../images/ds-definition2.jpg)
* Mirrored parts

  ![](../images/ds-definition3.jpg)Part file isn't considered as duplicate if:
* It contains different body numbers.

  ![](../images/ds-definition4.jpg)
* Tolerance

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How often are parts indexed?

Newly checked-in parts are automatically indexed.

### Can I manually start the indexing process for newly checked-in parts?

No, indexing is automatically started by Vault Server.

### Why were some parts not indexed?

Anytime you add a file to the folder selected for indexing, the indexing is started. If you add a large amount of data, it may take some time before files are indexed and ready for search. Check the Job Queue for more details.

There are cases when part files couldn't be indexed. Some of the possible reasons are:

* Part file can be corrupted.
* It's not possible to get some of the following properties of the file: Area, Volume, Principal Moments.

Possible solutions include rebuilding all parts, or change Material or Mass of the part.

### Why the Duplicate Dashboard isn't showing any result?

After selecting a folder to be indexed, Vault creates jobs to create indexes for the files in the folder. The Job Processor may not be running or has not yet handled the jobs. You need to ensure that at least one Job Processor is logged into the Vault and processing the Jobs. Once the jobs are processed successfully, the Dashboard will show information after refreshing it.

For large folders that are chosen to be indexed for Duplicate Search, consider dedicating a Job Processor machine where only specific jobs are enabled.

### Why it isn't possible to index folders (not compatible server version)?

If folders aren't indexed, check your server version. Only 2020.2 and newer support Duplicate Search. You need to upgrade the server to a 2020.2 version or later, before you can configure the folders for indexing to view the data.

### Why can't I add folders so they will be indexed?

Some folders may have a limited access set by your administrator and you cannot select them for indexing. You need to contact your administrator for help.

### Is indexing performed on all modal states?

No, only primary states are indexed.

### Revit Vault Add-in

# Revit Vault Add-in

A vault is a repository where documents and files are stored and managed. Autodesk Vault is a data management system that offers file security, version control, and multi-user support. Autodesk Vault integrates with Autodesk Revit Architecture, MEP, and Structure.

Autodesk Vault is both a server and a client interface.

* The server provides the following:

  + **Centralized file store:** Autodesk Vault server stores the master copies of all your documents and designs and keeps the master copies of all user files in a common, secure, and centralized location. By storing all of your data in a common, centralized location, you can easily share and manage all of your information with your design team. The files are stored on the server in such a way that they can be easily retrieved using the server console. However, this file store can reside on a different drive or even on a completely different server from the vault database.
  + **Relational database:** Autodesk Vault server contains a database that stores data about the files, such as file names, user names, properties, versions, and relationships between files. The database is managed using the server console.
  + **Access and information:** The Autodesk Vault Server software provides users with access to their files and maintains information about the status of those files including which users have permission to change and update the files. When changes are made to files, Autodesk Vault maintains a version history of all changes and provides a convenient mechanism for users to gain access to the latest versions as well as previous versions.
* The client consists of two components:

  + **Autodesk Vault:** Autodesk Vault is a stand-alone client providing full access to the vault. This is the user interface for managing all data within the vault.
  + **Vault add-in for Revit:** A client addition to the Revit user interface that allows users to perform common vault tasks without leaving the Revit environment.

## Autodesk Vault Concepts

Autodesk Vault software is a client-server application. In a typical installation, you install the server portion of the software on a shared computer, and then install the client software (Autodesk Vault and Revit add-in) on individual workstations. During installation, you have the option to install each of the components required for each workstation and, when applicable, for each server.

The vault server stores and maintains the files and metadata that make up the vault. The server software can be installed on a server or workstation that is shared by all users or, for a single user, the server can be installed along with the client on a single, isolated workstation. The database is managed by the Autodesk Data Management Server console.

The vault client consists of the Autodesk Vault stand-alone client and add-ins for most Autodesk design products including Revit. The clients are installed on all workstations that need to access the vault.

## Revit Vault Add-in Concepts

There are two essential concepts to understand when working with the Revit Vault add-in.

1. **Using Revit Server or work shared central files–** The Revit add-in does NOT require a check out. This behavior is unique and is unlike all other Vault add-ins where you must check a file out of the vault before you can modify it. Copies of the project file are added to Vault at specified milestones or automatically after a Revit Synchronization with Central.

   Note: Revit Server files and work shared central files can only be added to Vault using the Synchronize with Central command.
2. **Using Vault with non-shared project files–** The project file can be downloaded using the Open from Vault command. This will automatically check out the file for editing. Once you are done editing the file, check the file back into the vault by using the Save to Vault command.

#### Using Vault with Revit

# Using Vault with Revit

The workflow for using the Revit Vault add-in is easy and straightforward. The following list is an overview of the Revit Vault add-in best practice workflow.

## Revit Vault Add-in Setup

1. Before installing Vault and the Revit Vault add-in, determine the installation setup best suited for your company. Installing Vault on a system that is too small can limit functionality or require reconfiguration in the future.
2. Configure Autodesk Vault server behavior using the Autodesk Data Management Server console. The administrator must create a user account for each person who needs access to the vault. A user account consists of a login name and password. Refer to the help in the server console for more information.
3. Install Revit and the Vault Client on the client workstation.

Note: Refer to the Vault Installation Guide for more information on installing and configuring your environment for Vault.

## General Workflow for Shared Project Files

Follow these steps to work with a shared project file.

1. In Revit, log into Vault using the Log In command on the Vault ribbon tab.
2. Open or create a local copy of the project file.
3. Perform one of the following steps:

   * Synchronize with Central.

     A copy of the synchronized file is automatically added to your Vault.
   * Select Save to Vault on the Vault Ribbon.

     A new file version is added to the Vault without synchronizing with the Revit Server.

   Note: You may be prompted to select a folder location within Vault. This prompt can be hidden by configuring the Share Path property in Vault.

## General Workflow for Non-shared Project Files

Follow these steps to work with a non-shared project file.

1. Open a project file with Revit or click Open from Vault on the Vault ribbon.

   Note: Open from Vault automatically checks the file out of the vault.
2. Make your changes to the file.
3. Select Save to Vault on the Vault Ribbon.

   If this is the first time the file is being saved to the Vault, it is added to the Vault as a new file and checked in. If the file already exists in the vault, the file is checked back into the Vault as a new version.

**Parent page:** [Revit Vault Add-in](GUID-7109C619-6DE3-4725-A8B4-45459DC0C3B5.htm)


#### Open Revit File from Vault

# Open Revit File from Vault

Opening a file from the vault opens an existing Revit previously added to vault. When selecting the latest version of a file, Revit Server files and Central work shared files are opened from their respective locations just as they would be if opened from Revit.

Opening a historical version of a file or a Read Only version of the file downloads a copy of the file from Vault and opens it for viewing.

Opening a non-work shared file for editing automatically checks out the file unless the Read-Only option is selected.

Each of the following conditions must be met to open a file from the vault for editing:

* You must be logged into the vault that contains the file that you want to edit.
* The file must be in a checked-in state. It cannot be checked out to another user.
* You must have permissions to check out the file for editing.

**Open a Revit File from Vault**

1. Click Open from Vault on the Vault ribbon in Revit.
2. Navigate to the file that you want to open and click OK.

Note: If a file is not available for editing, a warning message appears. Files that are locked cannot be checked out of the vault.

**Parent page:** [Revit Vault Add-in](GUID-7109C619-6DE3-4725-A8B4-45459DC0C3B5.htm)


#### Save a Revit File to Vault

# Save a Revit File to Vault

Non-work shared files are added to a vault using the Save to Vault command. When a file is Saved to Vault, it is automatically checked into the vault.

Note: Save to Vault can only be used on Non-work shared files and Revit Family files.

Make sure that your [folder mappings](GUID-A84F0F54-36D2-411C-9584-6153B50CEB21.htm) are in place before adding files to the vault with the Revit Vault Add-in. This folder mapping is used to determine where to add or update the file in Vault.

After Saving a file to Vault, if you continue to edit the file, the file is automatically checked back out.

Note: See [Using Vault with Revit](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-49694A24-A93A-4AA8-A182-10F233F10A7C) for instructions on saving a work shared project file.

# Searching Revit Family Files in a Vault

Search for a specific family type and load the type(s) into a Revit project file or a Revit Family file using the [Vault Load Family](Searching-Revit-Family-Files-in.htm) dialog.

Note: The [Revit Indexing Service](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-4A75A76F-309F-4F73-B536-02CAF74477D6) must be enabled by an administrator in the ADMS Console before you can search family types.

## Understand the Search Family Files User Interface

The Search Revit Family Files feature allows you to locate family types quickly across multiple family files.

![](../images/dialog-loadfamilysearch-doorscategory.png)

Understanding how the search interface works will help you make the most of this functionality.

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| *Content Search Box* | The Content Search Box lets you enter a keyword search. Keywords can be a value or a parameter which has been indexed from the Revit Family files placed in Vault.  You can enter a single word or multiple words. If multiple words are entered, all words must exist as part of the family parameters. |
| *Address Bar* | Displays the current folder when browsing files. When you choose a specific family file, the address bar displays the term Search Results and the results are listed in the grid beneath.  Note: When the address bar is changed from Search Results to a folder, all parameters are cleared. |
| *Search Conditions List* | Each time you select a parameter value or type a parameter value into the search field, the value is added to the Search Conditions List. When you select a Category type from the default list, the Search Conditions List is updated with the value: *Category: Category Name.* For example, if you select the category Doors, the Search Conditions List will show *Category:Doors* as one of its values.  Each search value can be removed at any time or in any order. When removing a value, the search results in grid refresh to match the remaining search parameters. |
| *Available Parameters List* | Before you begin searching, the Parameter List shows the Type Categories of all of the Families stored in Vault. Once a Category is selected, parameters associated with the selected category are displayed. A number beside the parameter indicates the number of values for that parameter. Each available value for that parameter is listed as a child of the parameter, with a number beside each value indicating the number of family types that would be displayed if selected. |
| *Grid* | The grid displays the Revit Family types that meet the current search parameters. Select a Revit Family type to load that family type.  Note: If you select a Revit Family file, the Search Conditions List updates to include the family file name (i.e., File:FileName.rfa). |
| *Result Count* | The number of family types in the current search results displays in the Result Count window. Whenever the search parameters change, this count updates to reflect the new number of family types returned. |
| *Page Control* | The page control lets you cycle through the results in the grid. The grid displays up to 100 results at a time. |

#### Linking Files from Vault

# Linking Files from Vault

Learn about linking files stored in a vault to the current Revit project.

Link from Vault lets you link a file stored in the Vault to the current Revit Project. The advantage of using the Link from Vault is that there is no need to know where the latest version of the file is. If the latest version is located on the Revit Server, then the Revit Server version is linked too. If the file is a non-work shared file, it is downloaded from Vault and linked to the current project and will continue to be managed by Vault.

You can search the vault for a folder or file at any time by clicking the Find button.

Note: See [Searching Vault](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-893F17B8-10C8-4314-BCD9-68C47E688B98) for details about constructing and executing a search.

## The Link from Vault Dialog

You can select a file in Vault to be linked to the current Revit project and specify position options for the linked file on the Link from Vault dialog.

![](../images/dialog-revit-linkcadfilespic1.png)

## Supported File Types

Link from Vault supports these file types:

* .dgn
* .dwf
* .dwfx
* .dwg
* .dxf
* .ifc
* .rvt
* .sat
* .skp

## Position Options

You can select a positioning preference when you link a file into the current Revit project.

The following table describes the positioning options available for selection.

| Option | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Auto–Origin to Origin | Revit places the import's world origin at the Revit project's internal origin. If the import object has been drawn at a large distance from its origin, it may display at a large distance from the model. To test this, set the zoom to Zoom View to Fit. |
| Auto–By Shared Coordinates | Note: This option is for Revit files only.  Revit places the imported geometry according to its position with respect to the shared coordinates between the two files. If there is no current shared coordinate system between the files, Revit notifies you, and uses Auto–Center to Center positioning. See [Shared Positioning](http://wikihelp.autodesk.com/Revit/enu/2013/Help/00001-Revit_He0/2278-Collabor2278/2470-Shared_P2470#WS46B90C3CB2C58CAD197A37CFC7FA555F3-8000).  Important: When a link is inserted using shared coordinates, the position is correct but the shared site must be manually configured. Refer to the section below on Manually Configuring a Site. |
| Manual–Origin | The imported document's origin is centered on the cursor. |
| Manual–Base Point | The imported document's base point is centered on the cursor. Use this option only for AutoCAD files that have a defined base point. |
| Manual–Center | Sets the cursor at the center of the imported geometry. |

## Worksets

If you are working with linked worksets, all worksets from the work-shared link are loaded and displayed.

#### Importing Files from Vault

# Importing Files from Vault

Import from Vault lets you import CAD files or images stored in a vault into the current Revit project.

However, unlike Link from Vault, when the project is saved to Vault, only the project is updated. Any uses/used-by relationship between the project and the imported file are not saved. This means if a link is modified, the file must be reimported to see the changes.

## The Import from Vault Dialog

You can select a file in Vault to import into the current Revit project. You can also specify position options for the imported file on the Import from Vault dialog.

![](../images/dialog-revit-importfromvaultdialog.png)

## Supported File Types

You can import the following types of CAD files from a vault:

* DGN
* DWG
* DXF
* SAT
* SKP

In addition, you can import these types of images from a vault:

* BMP
* JPG
* JPEG
* TIF

## Position Options

You can select a positioning preference when you import a file into the current Revit project.

The following table describes the positioning options available for selection. Refer to [Import and Link Options for CAD Formats and Revit Models](https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2025/ENU/?guid=GUID-D184A004-D0BF-44D1-9C02-99480B129CAD) for more information.

| Option | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Auto–Origin to Origin | Revit places the import's world origin at the Revit project's internal origin. If the import object has been drawn at a large distance from its origin, it may display at a large distance from the model. To test this, set the zoom to Zoom View to Fit. |
| Auto–By Shared Coordinates | Note: This option is for Revit files only.  Revit places the imported geometry according to its position with respect to the shared coordinates between the two files. If there is no current shared coordinate system between the files, Revit notifies you, and uses Auto–Center to Center positioning. See [Shared Positioning](http://wikihelp.autodesk.com/Revit/enu/2013/Help/00001-Revit_He0/2278-Collabor2278/2470-Shared_P2470#WS46B90C3CB2C58CAD197A37CFC7FA555F3-8000).  Important: When a link is inserted using shared coordinates, the position is correct but the shared site must be manually configured. Refer to the section below on Manually Configuring a Site. |

When opening a legacy .rvt file or when adding sheets of a new .rvt file to a legacy .psg file, you may get an error stating the following:*The specified XML file is invalid. Its scheme is not supported by the Plot command. Please select a valid plot list file.*

This error means that the .psg file is empty and has no XML in it. Follow these steps to fix the .psg file:

1. Open Vault Client.
2. Locate the PSG file that generated the error.
3. Click the Plot icon to open the Plot Manager.
4. In the Plot Manager dialog, choose the Vault location of the PSG file.
5. Click OK and close the Plot Manager dialog.
6. Refresh Vault to see that the new version of the PSG file is created.

The missing XML is now included.

#### Sync on Demand

# Sync on Demand

When working with Revit server files or Work shared central files the only way to add or update a file in Vault is through the Synchronize with Central command in Revit. There are several options that can be set for adding a new version of the file to the Vault. At any time, the Synchronize on Demand button can be used to initiate synchronization. By clicking the Synchronize on Demand button it will toggle from:

![](../images/icon-revitaddin-sync.png)

to:

![](../images/icon-revitaddin-noupdateonsync.png)

If the button is set to Update on Synchronize when a Synchronize with Central executes, the current version of the Revit file is added to vault. After the update the button automatically toggles back to No Update on Synchronize.

#### Restore a Revit Project File

# Restore a Revit Project File

A Revit project may be restored to any point in time for which a backup was created.

This process supports rolling backward and forward through the snapshots. It is also possible to open a snapshot for comparison without disrupting the project in process.

## Restore a Central Project File

1. Ensure all users are disconnected from the central file.
2. Log into Autodesk Vault Professional from the Vault ribbon in Revit.
3. Click Open from Vault on the Vault ribbon.
4. Select the version of the file to open from vault.
5. From the Revit Save As command, save the file as a Central file to the Network share location.
6. Close the file.
7. Click Open from Vault on the Vault ribbon again.
8. Select the file and select the latest version.
9. Select Ok.

The opened file should be a local copy of the central file.

## Restore a Revit Server Project File

1. If the file exists on the Revit Server, ensure that all users are disconnected from the Revit Server file and delete it from the Revit Server.
2. Log into Autodesk Vault Professional from the Vault ribbon in Revit.
3. Click Open from Vault on the Vault ribbon.
4. Select the version of the file to open from vault.
5. From the Revit Save As command, save the file to the Revit Server location.
6. Close the file.
7. Click Open from Vault on the Vault ribbon again.
8. Select the file and select the latest version.

#### Select a Shared Parameters File in Vault

# Select a Shared Parameters File in Vault

Shared parameters are definitions of parameters that you can add to families or projects. Shared parameter definitions are stored in a .txt file independent of any family file or Revit project; this allows you to access the file from different families or projects. This file is referred to as the Shared Parameters file.

Note: Refer to the Revit help for more information on using a Shared Parameters file.

The Shared Parameters file can be stored in the Vault and activated from the Shared Parameters button on the Revit Vault ribbon.

Tip: Autodesk recommends creating a shared parameters folder in the vault. Since there may be multiple types of .txt files a user can browse to inside a vault, a shared parameters folder makes it easy for users to differentiate which .txt files are parameter files.

**Select a Shared Parameters File in a Vault**

1. Open a project file and select Shared Parameters on the Revit Vault Ribbon.

   ![](../images/icon-revit-sharedparameters.png)

   The currently active Shared Parameters file is shown at the bottom left of the Select Shared Parameter File dialog.

   ![](../images/dialog-revit-selectsharedparametersfile.png)
2. Select the .txt Shared Parameters file that you want to activate and slick Select.

   The latest version of the file is downloaded and set as the active Shared Parameters file.

   Note: Vault does not confirm the legitimacy of the shared parameters file, so if you select an invalid .txt file in the vault, it will still be activated as the Shared Parameters file.

#### Properties and the Revit Vault Add-in

# Properties and the Revit Vault Add-in

When a Revit Project is checked into a vault, the Vault Server extracts the properties associated with the project, including custom properties created in Revit.

Note: Write-back support is not available for custom properties. Custom properties are treated as read-only.

## Mapping Properties

If you want users to be able to search and edit properties for Revit projects in Vault, the properties must be mapped to [user-defined properties (UDPs)](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-1EC10936-9D84-4179-AEE3-59DD1B3E003C) in the Vault client.

Important: Revit properties are extracted as text data types, even if they are dates, and cannot be mapped to date type UDPs. Custom UDPs should be created with a text data type before mapping to Revit properties.

Choose Revit Models as the Content Source Provider when mapping in the client.

Note: By default, the Author property is mapped to the Author (UDP).

#### Exclude Uploading Revit Linked Files to Vault Server

# Exclude Uploading Revit Linked Files to Vault Server

You can exclude uploading of Revit linked files to the vault server by manually adding a property called "ExcludeLinkedFiles" and setting this property to True/False in the ApplicationPreferences.xml file.

To configure this setting:

1. Close any Revit application.
2. Open ApplicationPreferences.xml file in a text editor. (Typically found at "<C:\Users(username)\AppData\Roaming\Autodesk\Revit 20xx Vault Addin>")
3. Add the following line under the Category "ApplicationOptions" with the desired value (true/false).

   * <Category ID="ApplicationOptions">
   * <Property Name="ExcludeLinkedFiles" Value="True" />
   * </Category>
4. Relaunch the Revit application.

#### Configure Revit Vault Add-In Options

# Configure Revit Vault Add-In Options

To best use the Vault Revit Add-in, folder mappings should be configured to at least the top level folder of the Revit projects, Revit Server, or Revit Central file locations.

The folder mapping capability provides an easy and flexible way to map multiple folder structures between Vault and the Revit Server to help streamline collaboration.

To optimize collaboration, configure sharing and mapping options in Revit.

  + **Always Upload on Synchronization with Central** – Every time a Synchronize with Central command is performed, a new version of the file is added to the vault.
  + **Upload Every # hours on Synchronization** – When a Synchronize with Central command is performed, if the version in the vault is older than the set number of hours, then a new version is added to the vault.
  + **No automatic upload on Synchronization** – When a Synchronize with Central command is performed, no upload occurs.
  + **Upload on Close** – A new file version is added to the vault whenever a file is closed and changes have been made to local file.
* **Visualization Attachment Options**

  Visualization Attachment Options control how Visualization files are created when files are added through the Vault add-in for Revit.

  + **Send to Job Server**–When a file is added to vault, a job is queued to an active job server.
  + **Create when adding files**-Each file generates a visualization file during the add process.

    Note: This option adds processing time to the add operation.
  + **Do not create**–No visualization files are generated when a file is added to the vault.
  + **Include linked files**–Ensures that any selected options list above also apply to linked files.
* **Add to Vault**

  Configure which types of files cannot be added to the vault in the Add to Vault section.

  + If a file extension is listed, that file type cannot be added to the vault with Add File or Add Folder commands.

    Clear the Filter by extension check box if you do not want to filter out files with the listed extensions. This allows you to keep the list, and turn the filter on and off as needed.

##### Configure the Share Path for the Revit Vault Add-in

# Configure the Share Path for the Revit Vault Add-in

Share Path is a vault property that may be added to a vault folder. This property provides vault with the location of the Revit central project files on your network.

The advantage of using the Share Path is that the Revit add-in will duplicate the folder structure of the network share inside vault. Having the Share Path configured also removes the need for users to select the vault folder while adding files to the vault.

By configuring Share Path, the folder structure on the network share is duplicated automatically in the vault as files are added.

Note: Sharepath is only need for Add Files and Add Folder commands. All other Revit commands use the mapped folders defined in the Mapping options.

1. Log in to the Autodesk Vault Professional stand-alone client.
2. Select or create a vault folder that contains the project folders.
3. Go to the Edit menu and select Edit Properties.
4. On the Property Edit dialog click Select Properties.
5. On the Customize Fields dialog, set the Select available fields from value to Folders.
6. Select Share Path on the left side of the dialog, click Add -> to move SharePath to the right side.
7. Click OK to close the dialog.
8. On the Property Edit dialog, enter the path to the network share location of the Revit project folders in the Share Path field.
9. Click OK to close the Property Edit dialog.
10. Review the Property Edit Results and click OK if everything is accurate.
11. Open a local copy of a Revit project that has its central file in the network share path that you just added to the vault.
12. Log into vault from Revit.
13. When the next Revit Synchronize with Central is performed, a new version of the file is added to the vault.

Note:

When using Revit Server, the Sharepath value should match the value in the RSN.ini file for the Revit server being mapped. For example if the server's IP address is 10.1.1.10 then the value for the Share path should be RSN://10.1.1.10.

## Autoloader

# Autoloader

Autodesk Autoloader bulk uploads data to a vault.

Autoloader does not affect the original source files. The source files are copied to a temporary location on the local computer before being uploaded. If you are uploading Autodesk Inventor files, once any file resolution issues have been addressed and the copied files have been organized for use with a vault, they are then uploaded to the vault.

## System Requirements

* Autodesk Vault
* Autodesk Data Management Server Console
* If you use the default Microsoft SQL Server Express to manage your vault, make sure the total amount of data in your vault after upload is less than 10 gigabytes or 50,000 versions. If your vault data will exceed these specifications, upgrade to full Microsoft SQL Server before installing Autoloader and uploading your data.

## Supported Data Formats

* Autoloader supports Inventor R10 and newer data.
* Autoloader supports AutoCAD R14 (and AutoCAD R14 products) and newer data.
* Autoloader supports MicroStation DGN files.

## Upload Recommendations

Follow these guidelines for autoloading data into the vault:

* Close as many applications as possible while autoloading data.
* Autoloader copies all files to be uploaded to a temporary folder on the system that is running Autoloader. Therefore, enough free space must be available to accommodate the duplication of the files. If you are publishing DWF or DWFX files, enough space must also be available to accommodate the visualization files as well.
* If you are autoloading Inventor files and not publishing DWF files, upload in batches no greater than 30,000 files.
* If you are autoloading Inventor files and publishing DWF files, upload in batches no greater than 20,000 files.
* If you are autoloading AutoCAD or DWG files without publishing DWF, upload in batches no greater than 50,000 files.
* If you are autoloading AutoCAD or DWG files and publishing DWF, upload in batches no greater than 30,000 files.

## Replicated Environment Requirements

If you are using Autoloader in a replicated environment, you must meet the following requirements to be able to upload data to a vault using Autoloader.

* You must have administrator privileges for the vault.

## Multiple Instances of Autoloader

Users can run more than one instance of Autoloader on separate workstations while logged into the vault at the same time. Once the administrator runs Autoloader on the server and customizes the Design and Library folder names, additional instances of Autoloader can run concurrently. Users are responsible for ensuring that the datasets uploaded do not overlap.

## Before using Autoloader

* Autodesk strongly recommends that you fully back up all vaults before autoloading data.
* In order to use Autoloader, you must disable Enforce Unique File Names in the Vault.
* The Upload Report generated after files have been uploaded can only be viewed on the machine that created the report.
* A Vault product must also be installed on the same system as Autoloader.
* DWF publishing is not supported when autoloading Inventor data with Inventor LT.
* AutoCAD files with model documentation drawing views of Inventor references are not supported with Autoloader.
* If Inventor needs to re-register with the operating system while Autoloader is running, Inventor's re-registration process may cause Autoloader to close. Be sure to save all Scan and Upload reports before starting Inventor with Autoloader running.
* In order to publish visualization files (DWF or DWFx) for Inventor iParts, Autoloader requires that Microsoft Office Excel is installed.
* It is required that all Inventor files be uploaded into the same folder in the vault. The default name of this folder is Designs but you may rename it. However, you may not rename the Designs folder after you have already uploaded files into it.
* If Direct 3D 9 is installed on your machine, it is recommended that you change the Inventor hardware setting to any value other than Direct 3D before doing DWF or DWFX publishing in Autoloader.
* AutoCAD file types may be uploaded to any folder in the vault.
* AutoCAD Electrical files, AutoCAD Mechanical files, and Mechanical Desktop files will all be uploaded to the vault as vanilla AutoCAD files. This may result in the loss of file relationships.
* Sheet Set Data will be uploaded to the vault as vanilla AutoCAD files. This may result in the loss of sheet set relationships. It is recommended that you use Sheet Set Manager to check in sheet set data.

## Launch Autoloader

1. Select Start > Autodesk > Autodesk Data Management > Autodesk Autoloader <version>.
2. When you are ready to begin, click [Next Step](GUID-67B9ED0F-BCEC-47F0-A4A9-85D9A87B291F.htm) to begin the Autoloader walkthrough.

### Autoloader–Select Data Source

# Autoloader–Select Data Source

Specify a folder to upload to a vault on the Select Data Source screen.

1. Click Select Folder.
2. In the Browse for Folder dialog, locate and select the folder containing the data to add to the vault, and then click OK.

   If the selected folder contains an Inventor file, Autoloader searches for all possible .ipj files. If multiple .ipj files are found, the Select Project dialog is displayed and you are prompted to select the .ipj file corresponding to the data you want to upload. If the project file is not listed, click Browse and then locate the .ipj file. Once the correct .ipj has been selected, click OK.

   Note: Only one folder can be uploaded at a time. If a folder has already been selected as a data source, you are prompted to decide whether or not the new folder replaces the existing folder as the data source.
3. The Select Data Source screen displays the folder structure of the selected project as well as the associated files. Files and folders can be selectively excluded from list of source files to be uploaded. The actual data is not impacted by Autoloader. Excluding either a file or a folder from the data source list only removes the item from the list. The actual files are not deleted.

   * To exclude a folder in the data source from being uploaded, select the folder and then click Exclude from Upload in the tool bar or right-click the folder and then select Exclude from Upload. You are prompted to verify removing the selected folder and its contents. Click Yes to remove the folder from the list. This prevents the folder from being uploaded to the vault. It does not affect the actual source data.
   * To exclude a file in the data source from being uploaded, select a file from the list on the right and then click Exclude from Upload in the tool bar or right-click the file and then select Exclude from Upload. You are prompted to verify removing the selected file. Click Yes to remove the file from the list. This prevents the file from being uploaded to the vault. It does not affect the actual source data.
4. Once you have selected a folder to upload and you have excluded any unnecessary files from the list, click Next.

### Autoloader–Scan Data

# Autoloader–Scan Data

After a folder has been selected as the data source, Autoloader scans the data to verify that all the file relationships resolve properly.

The files are scanned and a report is displayed in the Dependencies tab at the bottom of the screen indicating the files that contain unresolved references or are missing altogether. If any files fail to resolve, either open the file's parents in the associated CAD application and correct the problem or exclude the files and their parent files from being uploaded. You can fix the files without closing Autoloader and then re-scan any files that have been corrected. See the CAD application's help for more information on correcting missing references.

Note: You cannot proceed with the upload process until all of the files have been scanned and any resolution issues have been corrected. If you resolve file issues outside of Autoloader, click Scan again to process the files that have been fixed.

1. The files listed are all the files that were selected as the data source. All of the files must be scanned. You can incrementally scan groups of files using the file type filter or by using the check boxes to indicate which files to include in the scan.

   You can filter the list to show file types, based on your version of Autoloader.

   **Autoloader**

   * All File Types
   * All Autodesk Inventor Part Files (.ipt)
   * All Autodesk Inventor Assembly Files (.iam)
   * All Autodesk Inventor Presentation Files (.ipn)

   To filter the file list by file type, select a file type from the drop-down list.

   To skip a file during the scanning process, turn off the corresponding check box. The unchecked files are skipped during that scan. The skipped files must be scanned later before you can progress through Autoloader.

   To remove files from the list, select a file or files and then click Remove. You are prompted that the removed files may be added to the list again during the scanning process if they are related to other files that remain in the list. Click Yes to remove the selected files. Click No to keep the files in the list.

   To view a file, right-click on a file and select Open from the context menu. The file will launch in the appropriate application. If the correct application cannot be found, you will be prompted to select one from the web or from the list of installed programs.
2. Click Scan to validate the checked files.

   If a Find Duplicates process was previously run, click the drop-down arrow next to the Find Duplicates button and select Scan.

   Note: Click Stop at any time during a scan to halt the scan process.
3. The results of the scan indicate which files passed and which files require attention. To view the results of the scan, click >> to expand the dialog box.

   Click Export to save the results as an Excel file (.xls), as a comma separated values file (.csv), or an extensible markup language file (.xml). By default, the file is saved at the Data Analysis Report Folder location indicated.

### Autoloader–Map Vault Folders

# Autoloader–Map Vault Folders

After the files have been scanned, you must map the file folder structure to a folder structure or search path in vault.

Your data is never directly impacted by the actions of Autoloader.

The Resultant Vault View shows the folder structure of the vault.

If you are uploading an Autodesk Inventor project, the workspace, libraries, and content center library in the project need to be mapped to folders in the vault. The workspace folder can be mapped directly to the Designs folder in the vault or to any subfolder in the Designs folder. Libraries can be mapped directly to the Libraries folder in the vault or to any subfolder in the Libraries folder. However, Content Libraries are automatically mapped to the vault Content Center Files folder.

1. If the target folder for the workspace does not exist in the vault yet, right-click the Designs folder in the Resultant Vault View and then select New Folder. In the Create Folder dialog box, enter a name for the new folder and then click OK.

   If the library folder does not exist in the vault yet, right-click the Libraries folder in the Resultant Vault View and then select New Library Folder. In the Create Folder dialog box, enter a name for the new library folder and then click OK.
2. In the Target Location in Vault column associated with the folder to check in, click the browse button.
3. In the Browse Vault for Folder dialog box, select either the Designs folder or a subfolder to be mapped to the workspace for the project. This will create a subfolder called Designs under the Design folder. To map the workspace folder directly to the Designs folder without creating a subfolder, select the Direct Mapping check box.
4. Click OK. If the vault folder doesn't exist, click New Folder and create a new folder in the vault.
5. If libraries are being added to the vault, in the Target Location in Vault column associated with the library folder to check in, click the browse button.
6. In the Browse Vault for Folder dialog box, select either the Libraries folder or a subfolder to be mapped to the libraries for the project and then click OK. If the vault folder doesn't exist, click New Folder and create a new folder in the vault.
7. You can rename or delete any new folder created in the vault view. Select the folder and then click Rename to change the name of the new folder. Select the folder and then click Delete to remove the new folder.
8. The files from the data source will be copied to a temporary folder prior to being uploaded to the vault. The temporary folder location is displayed at the bottom of the screen. To change the temporary folder location, click Browse to select a different folder or create a new one and then click OK.
9. Click Next.

### Autoloader–Specify Data Subsets

# Autoloader–Specify Data Subsets

The Specify Data Subsets screen lists all the files that will be uploaded to the vault. You can choose to upload the entire file set, or specify unique subsets to be uploaded. You can also apply pre-defined file filters to the data source to upload clean subsets of the source data.

1. By default, all of the data will be uploaded to the vault. To upload only a specific file type, select a file type from the Data Filters list. Data filters depend on which version of Autoloader you are running:

   **Autoloader**

   * All Inventor data
   * Assembly files and dependencies
   * Drawing files and dependencies
   * Presentation files and dependencies
   * Library files
   * Standard Content (Content Center)
   * Only Part files and dependencies
   * All AutoCAD Data
   * All Data

   **Autoloader for Pro/ENGINEER**

   * All Pro/ENGINEER Assembly files (.asm)
   * All Pro/ENGINEER Drawing files (.drw)
   * All Pro/ENGINEER Form files (.frm)
   * All Pro/ENGINEER Mfg files (.mfg)
   * All Pro/ENGINEER Part files (.prt)

### Troubleshooting: Data Management Services

# Troubleshooting: Data Management Services

This topic includes links to information that can assist in working through an issue.

## Issue

When trying to connect and log into a Vault Server, the following error is displayed:

"<Productname>...could not find the Data Management Services on...<servername>"

The error message can be displayed using Internet Information Server (IIS) Server Certificate (SSL), or using the following software:

* Vault Basic
* Vault Professional
* Inventor, AutoCAD, Revit, Civil 3D, Plant 3D, ...or any other CAD addin.
* Word, Excel, PowerPoint
* Autodesk Data Management Server Console

### Solution

The error may appear if a major Windows Update on the Vault Server has recently occurred.

Repair the installation of Vault Server using the instructions in the article [Repairing, Uninstalling and Reinstalling the Vault Server software](https://www.autodesk.com/support/technical/article/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/Uninstalling-and-reinstalling-the-Vault-Server.html).

If a repair of Vault Server does not resolve the issue, or only one user is affected, use the troubleshooting steps in the article [Troubleshooting Autodesk Vault Client to Server Connectivity issues](https://www.autodesk.com/support/technical/article/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/Troubleshooting-Autodesk-Vault-Client-to-Server-Connectivity-issues.html).

**Parent page:** [Troubleshooting Errors and Messages](GEN-TROUBLESHOOTING-ERRORS.htm)


### Troubleshooting: Incompatibility Errors

# Troubleshooting: Incompatibility Errors

This topic includes links to information that can assist in working through an issue.

## Issue

While logging into the Vault Server, the following error message appears:

"<Vault Client Edition Year> is not compatible with the following applications on <VAULTSERVERNAME or VAULTIPADDRESS>"

...

The message may appear using:

* Vault Thick Client
* CAD Integration
* Thin Client

### Solution

1. Check if the Vault Client and Server are installed in environments supported by the software. See [Vault System Requirements](https://www.autodesk.com/support/technical/article/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/System-requirements-for-Autodesk-Vault-products.html).
2. Check disk space on the Vault Server and restart the Vault Server.
3. Check the Vault version.

   * Ensure that the Vault Client version being used is not higher than the Vault Server. See [Vault Client and Server compatibility with older releases](https://help.autodesk.com/view/VAULT/2026/ENU/?guid=GUID-334CC890-1F12-429C-9D6A-B964327CA590).
   * If the error is occurring when connecting to the Thin Client, make sure that the same version of the Thin Client is installed on the server, and that any previous version of the Thin Client is removed.
   * To resolve the inconvenience, uninstall newer version from client computer, install the same version/edition as Vault server or upgrade the Vault server to same version as client.
   * This error can occur if no Vault licenses are available. Regenerate the new license, and configure the license server to use the new license. See [How to download Vault Server, Client and AVFS from Autodesk Accounts](https://www.autodesk.com/support/technical/article/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/How-to-download-Vault-Server-in-Autodesk-Accounts.html).
4. Check the Vault edition.

   The Vault Client is not running the same edition of Vault (basic-or-professional) as the Vault Server.

   * A Vault Basic Client cannot connect to a Vault Professional Server.
   * A Vault Professional Client cannot connect to a Vault Basic Server.
5. The wrong Vault integration is registered with the CAD software.

   It is possible that the wrong version of the Vault integration is registered with the CAD client.

   If both Vault Basic and Vault Professional clients are installed, and unable to connect to the Vault Professional Server, it's possible that the Vault Basic integration is registered with the CAD software and taking priority. In that instance, uninstall\reinstall the Vault Professional CAD Integration. See [Uninstalling and reinstalling the Vault Integration](https://www.autodesk.com/support/technical/article/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/Uninstalling-and-reinstalling-the-Vault-Integration.html).
6. The Vault client has become corrupt. See [Uninstalling and reinstalling the Vault Client](https://www.autodesk.com/support/technical/article/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/Uninstalling-and-reinstalling-the-Vault-Client.html).
7. Restart Internet Information Services (IIS).

   The Windows World Wide Web service that Autodesk Vault Server uses can sometimes refuse more client connections when it runs out of memory. This can be easily rectified by restarting IIS. See [How to restart Vault servers "World Wide Web Publishing Service"](https://www.autodesk.com/support/technical/article/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/How-to-configure-Vault-servers-World-Wide-Web-Publishing-Service-to-automatically-restart-after-it-fails.html).
8. Ensure that all the services that Autodesk Vault Server uses are running (IIS, SQL, and the Autodesk Job Dispatch Service).

   Check that no Windows Updates are pending on the Vault server as often SQL server updates cause the server to stop. See [Are Vault Servers critical services running?](https://www.autodesk.com/support/technical/article/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/Are-Vault-Servers-critical-services-running.html)

   Note: It might be necessary to restart the Vault Server.
9. Ensure that the Vault Servers Web Service is configured correctly.

   If a configuration change in Internet Information Services (IIS) has recently been implemented, roll back that change. See [How to check if Vaults Servers, Web Service is configured correctly](https://www.autodesk.com/support/technical/article/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/How-to-check-if-Vaults-Servers-Web-Service-is-configured-correctly.html).
10. Install the latest updates on the Vault Server and the Client/CAD Software. Choose the product you’re using from the links below to find the updates you need.

    * [Vault Downloads](https://www.autodesk.com/support/technical/product/vault-products)
    * [Inventor Downloads](https://www.autodesk.com/support/technical/product/inventor)
    * [AutoCAD Downloads](https://www.autodesk.com/support/technical/product/autocad)
11. Check that the permissions are unmodified on the folder Vault Server uses to write to the log files.

    Autodesk Vault does not support changes to the permissions on the log file folder. The quickest solution to this is to uninstall and reinstall the Vault Server software. See [Uninstalling and reinstalling the Vault Server](https://www.autodesk.com/support/technical/article/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/Uninstalling-and-reinstalling-the-Vault-Server.html).
12. Proxy Server interfering with Vault.

    * See [Configure Vault to Use a Proxy Server](https://help.autodesk.com/view/VAULT/2026/ENU/?guid=GUID-3BA3F33B-C0BD-47B1-9DBC-3D9DB9A21ABB).
    * See [How to bypass a Proxy Server using the Application .config file for a Vault client or integration](https://www.autodesk.com/support/technical/article/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/Vault-Bypassing-a-Proxy-using-the-Application-config-file.html).
13. Windows Authentication is disabled on AutodeskDM virtual directory on IIS.

    Enable Windows Authentication in IIS Management. See [How To Enable Windows Authentication on Windows Server, AFTER installing Vault Server](https://www.autodesk.com/support/technical/article/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/How-To-Enable-Windows-Authentication-on-Windows-Server-AFTER-installing-Vault-Server.html).
14. Windows Server role "Windows Server Update Service" is uninstalled:

    * .NET and IIS roles were removed.
    * Reinstall the "Windows Server Update Service". See [Windows Server Update Services (WSUS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-server-update-services/get-started/windows-server-update-services-wsus).
    * After reinstalling, the "Windows Server Update Service" can be disabled in windows services.
15. DNS (Domain Name Service) problems are preventing computer names from being resolved to IP addresses.

    * Try connecting to the Vault Server using the IP Address instead of the hostname.
    * Run the command ipconfig /flushdns from the Command prompt of the client.
    * Edit the clients hosts files:

      + Navigate to C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc on the client machine.
      + Edit the "hosts" file with Notepad and map the server hostname to it's IP address.

# Troubleshooting: Dialogs not on Current Screen

## Issue

Users with varying monitor setups may experience difficulties with dialog boxes. These dialogs (checkout, copy design, errors, etc.) may not display on the primary screen, particularly when transitioning between multi-screen systems and a single laptop. This issue arises because it persist the last location of the dialog box, even if it's off-screen in the current monitor setup.

### Solution

To resolve this issue, command line utility can be used to reset the dialog locations.

1. Close the Autodesk Vault client.
2. Run the command line utility.

**Note:** If the client is running and the utility is run, a warning will be displayed to close the client first.

The command line utility has two options:

1. **Reset the dialog locations:** This option deletes the information or XML files which store dialog location settings, keeping everything else as is.

   `C:\Program Files\Autodesk\Vault Client {release}\Explorer\Connectivity.VaultPro.exe ResetDialogLocations`
2. **Reset Vault Client profile:** This option deletes all XML files related to Vault client.

   `C:\Program Files\Autodesk\Vault Client {release}\Explorer\Connectivity.VaultPro.exe ResetAllClientSettings`

##### File Administration Settings

# File Administration Settings

The Files tab on the Vault Settings dialog contains options for enforcing unique file names, disabling design file check in, specifying working folder options, and locating duplicates.

Note: In Autodesk Vault Basic, you can create and modify properties on the Files tab as well.

## Access the Files tab on the Vault Settings dialog.

1. Click Tools > Administration > Vault Settings.
2. Select the **Files** tab.

![](../images/vaultsettings-fileadministration.png)

### File Options

* Click Define to enforce unique identifying name for files in the vault. Use Find Duplicate Names to locate duplicate file names in the vault to help resolve any file name conflicts before enforcing unique file names. As a file administrator, you can enforce unique file names based on the file extension or folder location. You can enable files with specific extensions or files in specified folders to have duplicate file names. See [Enforce Unique File Names](GUID-B95F67C8-7843-4435-B632-4996A97FFEA5.htm) for more information.
* As a best practice, all CAD data should be added to a vault using the add-in client for the corresponding CAD application so as to retain and maintain file relationships. CAD data cannot be dragged and dropped into a vault or added through the vault client. By default, this practice is enforced. The Item data/BOM information should also be added by check-in via a native application and not via drag and drop. Turn off the Disable Check In of Design Files check box to allow CAD data to be added without using the corresponding add-in client. By doing so, file relationships will not be maintained.

  CAD data includes design files from the following applications:

  + AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT
  + Inventor
  + Revit
  + Navisworks
  + Civil 3D

#### Autodesk Inventor Project File for Vault Options

# Autodesk Inventor Project File for Vault Options

When working with Autodesk Inventor files in Vault, Inventor project files are involved in path change operations for Inventor files (such as renaming a file, moving a file, copy design or replace). Therefore, the correct Inventor project file must be specified so that Vault can resolve the Inventor files correctly.

The default Autodesk Inventor Project file for Vault can be specified by an administrator.

## Use the Default Project File

1. Launch Autodesk Vault, and then log in as administrator.
2. Select Tools > Administration > Vault Settings.
3. In the Vault Settings dialog box, click the **Files** tab.
4. In the Working Folder section, click **Define**.
5. On the Working Folder Options dialog, specify a default Inventor Project File for Vault Options.
6. Select Enforce consistent project file for all clients to disable individual client Inventor project setting.
7. Click OK.
8. On the Vault Settings dialog box, click Close.

**Parent page:** [Administration - Files](GUID-127DA162-F4A6-4C5E-86DF-896762269E4F.htm)


#### Enforce the Working Folder

# Enforce the Working Folder

Enforce the working folder so that all users share the same working folder.

A working folder location is defined by default, so you can begin working with a vault immediately. The default working folder is:

* My Documents\Vault.
* C:\Civil 3D Projects.

The default working folder location can be changed by a user to a custom location. The vault administrator can also enforce a standard location, ensuring that all users have the same working folder defined.

The enforced working folder path can be:

* a network path: \\designco\users\jstewart
* a local path: C:\users\bkeaton
* a path containing a system variable for a directory: \\designco\users\%username%
* a path beginning with 'My Documents': My Documents\Vault

When the working folder is enforced, any previous working folder settings are replaced with the new path. If a user has changed the default location, a message is displayed indicating that the vault administrator has enforced the working folder location the next time the user logs into the vault.

If an enforced working folder location cannot be applied to user settings, the previous user-defined location is used. If there is no previous user-defined location, MyDocuments\Vault is used.

If the enforced working folder does not exist and the user does not have the necessary privileges to create the folder, the user won't be able to get or check out any file until the local folder is created.

Enforce the Working Folder Location

Note: You must be assigned the role of Administrator to perform this action.

1. Select Tools > Administration > Vault Settings.
2. In the Vault Settings dialog box, click the Files tab.
3. In the Working Folder section, click Define.
4. In the Working Folder Options dialog box, specify whether clients can define a working folder or whether a consistent working folder location is enforced for all clients.
5. If the working folder location is being enforced, specify the location for the folder in the Client Working Folder field or click ... to browse for a location.

   Note: The enforced working folder path can be a:

   * Network path: \\designco\users\jstewart
   * Local path: C:\users\bkeaton
   * Path containing a system variable for a directory: \\designco\users\%username%
   * Path beginning with 'My Documents': My Documents\Vault
6. Click OK.

Note: This setting is only for commands executed by the Vault. If you are opening Inventor files from the Vault Client itself, for example, and there are multiple .ipj files in the vault that could be used to locate any referenced files, a "Select project file" dialog box will appear asking which project file Inventor should use to open the files. See Open a File from Vault for more information.

**Parent page:** [Administration - Files](GUID-127DA162-F4A6-4C5E-86DF-896762269E4F.htm)


#### Enforce Unique File Names

# Enforce Unique File Names

By default, the vault database enforces unique file names. The only restriction is that two files with the same name cannot exist in the same folder. With unique file names enforced, files in the vault must each have a unique, identifying name.

This rule is enforced when files are added to the vault, renamed in the vault, or restored to the vault. If unique file names are going to be enforced, it is recommended to set this option before any files are added to the vault, though it can be turned on at any time. Using Find Duplicates, you can locate duplicate file names in the vault to help resolve any file name conflicts before turning on this option.

As an administrator, you have the ability to enforce unique file names based on the file extension or folder location. You can enable files with specific extensions or files in specified folders to have duplicate file names.

## Best Practices for Enforcing Unique File Names

As a best practice, do not enforce unique file names if any files with duplicate names are checked out. If unique file names are enforced while a duplicate file name is checked out, the setting can be temporarily turned off to allow the file to be check back in, or the vault user can undo the checkout, and then rename the file before checking it back into the vault.

Enforce Unique File Names

1. Click Tools > Administration > Vault Settings.
2. Click the Files tab.
3. Click Define to set unique file name options in the vault.
4. Turn on the Enforce unique file name checkbox.

   Note: If any duplicate file names exist when this option is turned on, an error dialog is displayed stating that there are duplicate file names already in the vault preventing the setting from being turned on. If this happens, resolve the duplicate file names.
5. Click Find Duplicate Names to locate any duplicate file names in the vault.
6. Resolve any duplicate file names by renaming the files.
7. Turn on the Files with selected extensions checkbox to allow duplicate file names for files with specific file extensions.

   * To add an extension, enter the file extension in the text box and click "+" to add a new file extension.
   * To remove an extension, select the file extension and click "x" to remove the selected file extension.
8. Turn on the Files in specified folders checkbox to allow duplicate file names for files in the specified folder. Subfolders are automatically included in the selection.

   * Click "+" to add a folder. Navigate to the folder location in Vault and click OK.
   * Select the folder path and click "x" to remove the selected folder.

Note: If you remove the file extension or the excluded folder which has duplicate file names, a warning may prompt to let you know that duplicate file names exists.

1. Click Apply and then click OK.

#### Propagate Folder Permissions

# Propagate Folder Permissions

If you change the access permission for a folder containing subfolders, the Propagation of Permissions dialog displays so you can choose to propagate the permission change to the subfolders as well.

## Access Control List

1. In the Propagation of Permissions dialog, select one of the following options:

   * **Do not propagate to child folders** - the security settings are used for the current folder only. Changes are not propagated to subfolders.
   * **Propagate only changes (append permissions)** - any users or groups that have been added to or removed from the Access Control List on the current folder are added to or removed from the subfolders.

     Any changes to users or groups assigned to the current folder are propagated to any subfolders that also have those users and groups assigned. This is the default setting.
   * **Propagate entirely (replace permissions)** - the Access Control List and the permissions are used for the current folder and all subfolders contained in the current folder.
2. Click OK.

## Override the Access Control List

Security overrides that are applied to a folder with subfolders will launch the Propagation of Permissions dialog.

Note: An override is propagated to the subfolders as an override. If a state-based override is in effect on subfolders, a manual override can replace the state-based override.

1. In the Propagation of Permissions dialog, select one of the following options:

   * **Do not propagate to child folders–**The security settings are used for the current folder only. Changes are not propagated to subfolders.
   * **Propagate only changes (append permissions)–**Any users or groups that have been added to or removed from the Override Access Control List on the current folder are added to or removed from the subfolders.

     Any changes to users or groups assigned to the current folder are propagated to any subfolders that also have those users and groups assigned. This is the default setting.

#### Set Folder Membership

# Set Folder Membership

Specify which users have access to folders as well the level of their access by assigning members to folders.

Folder members can be individual users or groups of users. By default, no members are assigned to folders, meaning that all users have access to all folders. Once members are assigned to the Access Control List (ACL) for a folder, any users requiring access to that folder must be assigned to Access Control List for that folder.

See [Access Control Lists](Access-Control-Lists-acls-.htm) and [Security Overrides](Security-Overrides.htm) for more information.

## Set Folder Membership

1. Right-click on a folder and then select Properties or choose Properties from the File menu.
2. In the Properties dialog box, select the Security tab.
3. The Access Control List shows the users and groups associated with the current folder and their permissions.

   Note: If the Access Control List is empty, all users have access to all folders. Once any members are assigned to the Access Control List for a folder, any users requiring access to that folder must be assigned to Access Control List for that folder.

## Add a Member to a Folder

1. Click Add.
2. In the Add Members dialog box, select the users or groups to assign to the current folder and then click Add.
3. Click OK.
4. The Access Control List lists the members of the folder. Select a member for whom to configure the folder permissions.
5. In the Permissions box, enable or disable the Allow and Deny check boxes for each permission.

   | Permission | Access |
   | --- | --- |
   | Read | * Allow-Files can be viewed from the folder. * Deny-The folder and Files cannot be viewed. If a member is denied read access then they are not allowed Modify or Delete access either. * None-Files can be viewed provided that the member is not explicitly denied access based on state security. |
   | Modify | * Allow-Files can be modified. * Deny-Files cannot be modified. * None-Files can be modified provided that the member is not explicitly denied modify rights based on state security. |
   | Delete | * Allow-Files can be deleted * Deny-Files cannot be deleted. * None-Files can be deleted provided that the member is not explicitly denied delete rights based on state security. |

   For example, for Read-only access, select the Allow check box for Read, and the Deny check box for Modify and Delete.
6. Click OK.
7. If the security has been changed on a folder containing subfolders, you are prompted to select how the security changes are propagated to the subfolders. Select a method of propagation and then click OK.

## Remove a Member from a Folder

1. From the Access Control List, select a member of the folder.
2. Click Remove.
3. Click OK. The selected member can no longer access the folder.

Note: Select Deny for all three permissions to restrict a member of a group from accessing a folder to which the group has access. Add the restricted member as an individual on the Access Control List and then set the permission for that member to No Access.

#### Remove File Reservation

# Remove File Reservation

Administrators can remove the reservation on a file checked out to another user, making the file available in the vault for other users.

Files that are checked out are reserved and cannot be checked out by another user until the original user checks the file back in to the vault or performs an Undo Check Out.

Unlike Undo Check Out which is restricted to the current user's files, removing a file reservation can be performed by the administrator on any file checked out to any user. For example, if a user leaves the company or is on vacation and there are still files checked out to that account, the administrator can remove the reservation on the files so that the files are again available to other users. You must be an administrator to perform this action.

Note: Removing the reservation on a file discards any changes made by the user to whom it was checked out.

**Remove File Reservations**

Note: You must be assigned the role of Administrator to perform this action.

1. In the main window, select a file or files that are currently checked out.
2. Select File > File Control.
3. Select Remove Reservation. You are prompted that removing the reservation on the selected files means that changes made to the files will be lost. Click Yes to continue.

The status of the selected files is updated in the file list to indicate that they are no longer checked out to any users.

**Parent page:** [Administration - Files](GUID-127DA162-F4A6-4C5E-86DF-896762269E4F.htm)


#### Manage File Type Restrictions

# Manage File Type Restrictions

Define the list of files types to be enforced by the design file restriction.

As an administrator, you can define the list of design files not to be checked in when the "Enforce Restriction for Check In of Design Files" is turned on. You can add the file extensions to the user-defined list but can't remove the system default extensions.

With this restriction, the user can't add restricted files via Vault Client (drag-and-drop or "Add Files" feature). They can only add restricted files using the add-in client for corresponding CAD applications to retain and maintain file relationships.

To view/update file extension restriction:

* Go to Vault Setting, and click the **Files** tab.
* Click **File Type Restriction**.

  The Manage File Type Restrictions dialog displays. The dialog lists all the system and user-defined file extensions.
* In the Manage File Type Restrictions dialog,

  + **Select**: Select the file extensions for restriction or, select the checkbox **Select all** to restrict all the file extensions.
  + **Add**: Enter the file extension in the text box and click "+" to add a new file extension for the restriction.
  + **Remove**: Select the file extension and click "x" to remove a file extension from restriction. You can only remove user-defined file extensions.
* Click **OK** to save the changes.

Click **Reset to Default** to restore original file extension settings.

#### Purging

# Purging

Learn about purging file versions in Vault.

As files in the vault are worked on over time, versions are created, taking up room in the vault. The versions range from the initial draft version, to versions representing work in progress to the final version. Using the Purge Wizard, you can manage the version history in a vault. Versions that are no longer needed can be purged from the vault, creating a more compact vault database and improving the overall performance of the vault.

The Purge Wizard allows you to specify criteria for removing versions from a vault. You specify the conditions that must be met in order for a file version to be kept in the vault. Versions that do not meet the specified criteria are then removed from the vault.

Note: You must be assigned the role of Administrator or Document Editor II to perform this action. Contact your Vault administrator to see if you have been given either of these roles. File versions being purged, and all related files must be checked into the vault before purging.

Purging rules can combine and apply to files. For instance, if there is no change in the lifecycle state but changed Revisions only, then the first version of the revision can be purged if the "Last" option is set for that state under the Control preferences. See [Edit Lifecycle State Control](GUID-02294D64-9ACA-4546-956E-095D9D7814B1.htm) for configuring your purge preferences for files assigned to a lifecycle definition to help manage Vault file retention.

**Basic rules of purging:**

* The latest version in a revision can't be purged (this revision is never removed). To remove a file and all its versions from a vault, use Delete.
* File versions that are labeled can't be purged.
* Files that are currently checked out can have their older versions purged.
* Children with a dependent parent version cannot be purged until the parent version has been purged.
* The Administrator role has a further restriction, and a version can't be purged if a parent exists and is not part of the existing action set.
* **For Autodesk Vault Professional**:

  + File versions linked to items in Vault Professional cannot be purged. To remove a version linked to an item, the item must first be deleted from the item master.
  + File versions marked as Controlled by the lifecycle definition may not be purged.
  + Files are purged based on revision and lifecycle rules. Configure the Version Selection Criteria section in the Purge dialog to purge files that are not controlled by a lifecycle.
  + Files without a revision scheme are considered a "null" revision and are not purgeable when configured with a lifecycle. To purge based on lifecycle control rules, a revision scheme must be assigned to the lifecycle, and the target of the purge must utilize the revision scheme.
  + Files are purged based on the state transition action. If the Purge action is enabled under the [lifecycle state transition action](GUID-B4443A39-A621-4E14-8A11-484EFBF3DB90.htm), the corresponding state change will trigger a purge for the changed files.

As an administrator, you can enable or disable the Trash Bin functionality in the **Vault Settings** > **Behavior** tab. Once you disable the Trash Bin functionality, the [Delete](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-3F7C632F-AEF1-4C54-A8B6-A50136BE1B79) workflow will return to permanently deleting the file or folder.

Note: Trash Bin feature is available only in Autodesk Vault Professional.

![](../images/new-2026-enable-trashbin.png)

## Options to empty trash bin

As an administrator, you can choose to automatically remove objects from the bin 30 days after deletion or manually empty the bin at any time. You can perform the following actions within the Trash Bin workflow:

* **Permanently delete:** This command works the same as [Delete](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-3F7C632F-AEF1-4C54-A8B6-A50136BE1B79) workflow when you disable the Trash Bin feature.
* **Empty the Trash Bin:** This command permanently deletes all files and folders in the Trash Bin.
* **Restore files:** This command restores selected files from the Trash Bin to their original location.
* **Restore folder and its contents:** This command restores the selected folders along with their contents to their original location.
* **Restore folder:** This command restores only the selected folders to their original location.

##### Move Files or Folders to Trash Bin

# Move Files or Folders to Trash Bin

You can move files and folders to the Trash Bin instead of permanently deleting them.

You must be assigned the role of an Administrator to perform this action. Contact your vault administrator to verify your role. Users assigned the role of Administrator can delete unconditionally, overriding the rules for deleting children and files that are currently checked out.

## Enable the Trash Bin feature

1. Go to the Behaviors tab in the Vault Settings dialog:
   * Click **Tools** > **Administration** > **Vault Settings**.
   * In the Vault Settings dialog, select the **Behaviors** tab.
2. In the Trash Bin section, check the **Enable Trash Bin** checkbox.

## Delete files or folders from a Vault

1. Select a file or folder.
2. From the Edit menu, select Delete.

   or

   Right-click the file, and then select Delete.

   You are prompted to confirm deletion.
3. Click Yes to delete the file or folder from the vault.

Note:

* All deleted files will not be visible in their original locations.
* Because of unique name validation, you may see an error when creating a file or folder with the same name as a deleted item, since it might still exist in the original location or Trash Bin.

## View the deleted files in the Trash Bin

When the Trash Bin feature is enabled, deleted files and folders are moved to the Trash Bin folder. Administrators and the users who deleted them can access the Trash Bin to view all deleted files and folders, including those removed from folders.

Note: All files from folders are listed in a flat structure at the root level of the Trash Bin, separate from their original folders. While both files and folders are displayed, the folders appear empty, because their contents are listed separately.

## Restoring files or folders

From the list of files, right-click on the file you want to restore, and select **Restore**.
The file will be restored to its original location.

Note: If the file was part of a deleted folder, the folder and its subfolders will also be restored, with the file placed back in its original location within the folder structure.

If the file cannot be deleted due to restrictions imposed upon it by the vault, such as it is currently checked out or it is labeled, an error dialog box is displayed. Vault administrators can ignore the restrictions and delete the file regardless.

## Disable the Trash Bin feature

When the Trash Bin feature is disabled, the system reverts to its original behavior, wherein the files and folders are permanently deleted directly upon deletion. This action cannot be undone.

1. Go to the Behaviors tab in the Vault Settings dialog:
   * Click **Tools** > **Administration** > **Vault Settings**.
   * In the Vault Settings dialog, select the **Behaviors** tab.
2. In the Trash Bin section, clear the **Enable Trash Bin** checkbox.

Note: When the Trash Bin is disabled, only the administrator can view the Trash Bin.

#### File, Folder, Items, and Custom Object Security

# File, Folder, Items, and Custom Object Security

Specify which users have access to files, folders, items, and custom objects, as well the level of their access by assigning members to the [Access Control List (ACL)](Access-Control-Lists-acls-.htm).

Note: This security functionality is not available in Vault Basic. Items and custom objects are available in Vault Professional.

## How Security Works

Autodesk Vault uses a dual-gate security paradigm that combines object security with state security. Users must have role permission, and combined object and state-based permissions to access a Vault object.

With the dual-gate security system, Administrators can control individual access to a Vault object based on organizational area or business line without worrying about a state-based security being the override. For example, an administrator can make it so that a group has read, write, delete, and download permissions but certain members of the group do not have some permissions while in various lifecycle states.

### Security Modes on Files, Folders, and Custom Objects

* **Object-based security–**security is derived from the object settings. This is the default option.

  Note: Items do not have object-based security.
* **State-based security–**available when a state-based ACL exists and is combined with object-based security.
* **Overridden security–**available when a state-based ACL is overriding object-based security, or when the administrator sets a manual override on the object.

### Legacy Security Still Available

Customers who prefer the legacy security model or who want to wait before adopting the new dual-gate security model, can still emulate the single-gate security model by using overrides in the [lifecycle definition](GUID-92A079F0-65A6-4FB5-B4DC-853DD6539445.htm). Select Override object-based security in the Definition Security drop-down of the Lifecycle Definition dialog to have every file that is using that lifecycle definition have security as an override.

### Making Changes

##### Access Control Lists (ACLs)

# Access Control Lists (ACLs)

The Access Control List lets you add and remove members to control who has access to certain files, folders, items, and custom objects. You can also control whether the member can only view the content, modify the content, and delete the content.

Note: Items and custom objects are available in Vault Professional.

A file, folder, or custom object that does not have an Access Control List defined uses object-based security.

Object-based security can be [overridden](GUID-AC1BBE27-4B24-4F99-8A95-2CF72C404F0B.htm). An override of security means that the ACL still exists on the object but is being overridden by a newly defined ACL. This is called an Override Access Control List or an Override ACL.

As long as an override ACL exists, the object-based security is ignored. If the user removes the override ACL then the object-based security becomes the new security. If an override ACL is active, only members and users in the ACL list have permissions with the object.

![](../images/dialog-security-acl-2022.png)

The following table explains each permission.

| Permission | Access |
| --- | --- |
| *Read* | * Allow - Content can be viewed. * Deny - Content cannot be viewed. * None -   + If member has explicit Allow permission at state-level,but object-based security is set to None, member is denied access.   + If a member is in two different groups and permissions at object-based security level in one group are set to None but set to Allow in the other group, the effective permission for the member at the object-based security level is Allow.   + If a member is in two different groups and permissions at state-based security level in one group are set to None but set to Allow in the other group, the effective permission for the member at the state-based security level is Allow.   + If permissions are combined (i.e., object-based and state-based security is applied), and either state or object-based security is set to None, the result is denied access.. |
| *Modify* | * Allow - Content can be modified. * Deny - Content cannot be modified. * None -   + If member has explicit Allow permission at state-level,but object-based security is set to None, member is denied access.   + If a member is in two different groups and permissions at object-based security level in one group are set to None but set to Allow in the other group, the effective permission for the member at the object-based security level is Allow.   + If a member is in two different groups and permissions at state-based security level in one group are set to None but set to Allow in the other group, the effective permission for the member at the state-based security level is Allow.   + If permissions are combined (i.e., object-based and state-based security is applied), and either state or object-based security is set to None, the result is denied access. |
| *Delete* | * Allow - Content can be deleted. * Deny - Content cannot be deleted. * None -   + If member has explicit Allow permission at state-level,but object-based security is set to None, member is denied access.   + If a member is in two different groups and permissions at object-based security level in one group are set to None but set to Allow in the other group, the effective permission for the member at the object-based security level is Allow.   + If a member is in two different groups and permissions at state-based security level in one group are set to None but set to Allow in the other group, the effective permission for the member at the state-based security level is Allow.   + If permissions are combined (i.e., object-based and state-based security is applied), and either state or object-based security is set to None, the result is denied access. |
| *Download* | * Allow - Content can be downloaded. * Deny - Content cannot be downloaded. * None -   + If member has explicit Allow permission at state-level,but object-based security is set to None, member is denied access.   + If a member is in two different groups and permissions at object-based security level in one group are set to None but set to Allow in the other group, the effective permission for the member at the object-based security level is Allow.   + If a member is in two different groups and permissions at state-based security level in one group are set to None but set to Allow in the other group, the effective permission for the member at the state-based security level is Allow.   + If permissions are combined (i.e.,i.e., object-based and state-based security is applied), and either state or object-based security is set to None, the result is denied access. |

## What if Object-Based Security Is Combined with State-Based Security?

The following use cases can be applied to one or more Vault objects when combined security (dual-gate security) is used.

Note: To use legacy security from Vault 2016 or earlier, also known as single-gate security, enable the Override Security option for the [lifecycle definition](GUID-92A079F0-65A6-4FB5-B4DC-853DD6539445.htm).

| Object ACL | State-Based ACL | Resulting ACL |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Allow | Allow | Allow |
| Deny | Deny | Deny |
| Deny | Allow | Deny\* |
| null | Deny | Deny |
| Allow | null | Deny |
| null | null | Deny |
| (not in ACL) null | Allow | Deny\* |
| Allow (subset group) | Allow (superset group) | Allow\* (subset group) |
| \*Resulting permission is different from the legacy (single-gate security) used in Vault 2016 or earlier. | | |

##### View Object Security

# View Object Security

Examine file, folder, Item, and custom object security through the context menu.

Note: Items and custom objects are available in Vault Professional.

You must be an administrator to view object security.

1. Right-click on a file, folder, item, or custom object in Vault and select Details.
2. In the Details dialog box, select the Security tab.

   ![](../images/dialog-security-acl-2022.png)

   * **Security Mode**

     Shows the security precedence for the selected object.

     + **Object-based security–**is security that is derived from the object. This is the default option and is the only option available if no other security is defined.

       Note: Items do not have object-based security.
     + **State-based security–**is available when a state-based Access Control List (ACL) exists and is combined with object-based security.
     + **Overridden security–**is available when a state-based ACL is overriding object-based security, or when the administrator sets a manual override on the object.
   * **Permissions** The ACL shows which groups and users are granted access to the selected object, and their respective permissions.

     Note: See [Access Control Lists](Access-Control-Lists-acls-.htm) for more information.
   * **Effective Security** At the bottom of the dialog, the Effective Security, which is the security currently in use by the object, is shown. In the example above, Override (state-based-or-manual) security is in effect.
3. Select the Effective Access tab to view user permissions for the object.

   ![](../images/dialog_EffectiveAccess_acl_2022.png)

   **Security Type**

   Select a security type to see a user's effective permissions for that security mode. This is primarily useful when both object-based security and state-based security are applied, and the administrator wants to finder a user's effective permissions.

   Note: Only individual user permissions can be viewed. Groups cannot be added on the Effective Access tab.

   **Permissions**

   The permissions list on the Effective Access tab is empty by default. Add ![](../images/icon-addmember.png) and remove ![](../images/icon_removemember.png) members to the list to view the type of access they have to the object under the selected security type. Change the security type to see how permissions are impacted.

   Note: The Effective Access tab is for viewing security permissions only. Adding and removing members does not change security permissions for the object. Permission changes must be performed on the Security tab.

#### Security Overrides

# Security Overrides

Specify which users have access to files, folders, items, and custom objects as well as the access level by assigning members to the Access Control List (ACL) for that Vault object.

Note: Items and Custom objects are available in Vault Professional.

After members are assigned to the [ACL](Access-Control-Lists-acls-.htm), any other users requiring access to that file, folder, item, or custom object must be assigned to the ACL for that Vault object.

Note: You must be an Administrator to view and override security on a Vault object.

**Files, Folders, and Custom Objects**–if object-based security is in effect, the security can be overridden. An override of security means that the object ACL still exists but is being overridden by a newly defined ACL. This is an Override Access Control List or an Override ACL. As long as an override ACL exists, the object ACL is ignored. If the administrator removes the Override ACL then the object ACL becomes the new security.

**Items**–override security replaces state-based security on items.

See [File, Folder, Item, and Custom Object Security](GUID-07AB6615-AFDD-4C86-96DE-A3D334AF454B.htm) for information on combined security and override security.

##### Manually Override Security Settings on a Vault Object

# Manually Override Security Settings on a Vault Object

Override security settings on a file, folder, item, or custom object in Vault.

Override security works differently, depending on whether the Vault object is an item or not.

**Files, Folders, and Custom Objects**–if object-based security is in effect, the security can be overridden. An override of security means that the object ACL still exists but is being overridden by a newly defined ACL. This is an Override Access Control List or an Override ACL. As long as an override ACL exists, the object ACL is ignored. If the administrator removes the Override ACL then the object ACL becomes the new security.

**Items**–override security replaces state-based security on items.

## Manually Override Security on a Vault Object

1. Right-click a file, folder, item, or custom object in the vault and select Details.

   You can also access the Details dialog by selecting Details from the File menu.
2. In the Details dialog, select the Security tab.
3. Select the Override security check box to enable the Access Control List associated with the Vault object and manually edit access permissions.

   Note: If the Override security check box is selected but no permission changes are made, the system assumes that the user wants to create a new security access control list with the same settings.
4. Configure the override access control list using the Add and Remove buttons.
5. Click OK.

Note: The Security Mode field now says Overridden security. This indicates that there is an Override ACL configured on the Vault object.

Deselect the Override Security check box at any time to restore the object-based security on files, folders, and custom objects. Items return to state-based security.

**Parent page:** [Security Overrides](GUID-67F7EED5-76C4-4C6F-806C-74D1518A8FF2.htm)


##### Override Security Based on State

# Override Security Based on State

Configure state-based security overrides on the Lifecycle Definitions dialog.

To apply state-based security, a state change needs to occur at the folder level. Follow these steps:

1. Select a folder.
2. If the folder is not already assigned to a category, choose the Change Category command and assign a category.
3. By assigning a category, a default state is assigned to the folder.
4. Select the folder and choose the Change State command.
5. Choose a state that has security configured on it. For example, the released state has an ACL defined for it out-of-the-box.
6. Right-click on the folder and select Details.
7. Select the Security tab.

   If the [lifecycle definition security](GUID-92A079F0-65A6-4FB5-B4DC-853DD6539445.htm) is set to Override Object-based security, the ACL displayed is the override ACL that was applied by the lifecycle state.

Note: For more information on how to configure the security of a lifecycle state, see Edit Lifecycle State Security.

**Parent page:** [Security Overrides](GUID-67F7EED5-76C4-4C6F-806C-74D1518A8FF2.htm)


##### Override Security on a Custom Object Instance

# Override Security on a Custom Object Instance

Editing the security of the custom object definition changes the security of each instance created in the Vault.

For example, editing the security for a custom object definition called Contacts would change the security for each instance of a Contact (e.g., Bob Smith, Marla Green, Bakersfield Motors, etc.)

However, if you want to customize the security for a particular custom object instance (e.g., only Bob Smith), use a security override.

Note: You must have permission in the custom object definition security to modify the security for a custom object instance. See [Define Security for a Custom Object Definition](GUID-173E7E40-8F5F-45FB-993D-DB96492321C0.htm) for more information.

Perform a security override on a custom object instance

1. Right-click on a custom object instance in the Vault and select Details.
2. Select the Security tab to view and modify security for the instance.
3. Notice the Security Mode field indicates that there is either state-based security or object-based security for the instance.
4. Select the Security Override check box.
5. Now that you are viewing the overridden security for the custom object instance, add users to the access control list (ACL) and modify their permissions, if needed.
6. Click OK.

The security override is applied to the custom object instance.

**Parent page:** [Security Overrides](GUID-67F7EED5-76C4-4C6F-806C-74D1518A8FF2.htm)


##### Edit a Security Override

# Edit a Security Override

Once an override Access Control List (ACL) has been applied, it can be edited or overridden by another override.

For example, assume that a folder has an override ACL that was assigned by a lifecycle state. The user can view the override and modify it by changing the entries in the list and/or by modifying the permissions of the access control entries.

1. Right-click a file, folder, or custom object in the vault and select Details.

   You can also access the Details dialog by selecting Details from the File menu.
2. Select the Security tab and notice the Security Override check box is enabled.
3. Make the desired changes to the ACL.

**Rule:** There can never be more than one override ACL on any Vault object and the last override ACL is always used, regardless of whether the override was manually applied or applied by a lifecycle state.

**Parent page:** [Security Overrides](GUID-67F7EED5-76C4-4C6F-806C-74D1518A8FF2.htm)


##### Delete a Security Override

# Delete a Security Override

If a file, folder, item, or custom object has an override, it can be removed.

1. Right-click a file, folder, item, or custom object in the vault and select Details.
2. Select the Security tab on the Details dialog.

   Notice the Security Override check box is selected and the Security Mode indicates that there is an override.
3. Clear the Security override check box.

The override is removed from the Vault object. Files, folders, and custom objects revert to object-based security. Items revert to state-based security.

#### Define Security for a Custom Object Definition

# Define Security for a Custom Object Definition

Configure security for a custom object definition. This security will be the system Access Control List (ACL) and will apply to all instances of the custom object definition.

Note: See [Custom Object Administration](GUID-E1BA9E4A-443F-43EA-B8BF-3CAA382C25A3.htm) for more information about creating custom object definitions.

Define Security for a Custom Object Definition

1. In the Autodesk Vault Client, click Tools >Administration >Vault Settings.
2. In the Vault Settings dialog box, select the Custom Objects tab and click Configure.
3. [Create a new custom object definition](GUID-6A40E321-37EE-4A6B-B991-468557A31136.htm) or [edit an existing custom object definition](Edit-an-Existing-Custom-Object.htm).
4. In the Security area, click the Configure... button.
5. Use the Add button to add existing users and groups to the list. Once the user or group is added to the list, select the user or group and modify the permissions if necessary.

   See [Access Control Lists (ACLs)](Access-Control-Lists-acls-.htm) for more information about permissions.
6. Users and groups can be removed from the ACL by clicking Remove.

Security changes are applied immediately to all instances of the custom object definition.

**Parent page:** [Security Administration](VLT-ADMIN-SECURITY.htm)


#### Edit Security for a Custom Object

# Edit Security for a Custom Object

Change the security on a custom object.

Important: Edits that are made to the security of the custom object definition affect all existing instances of the custom object.

## Edit Custom Object Definition Security

1. In the Autodesk Vault Client, click Tools >Administration >Vault Settings.
2. In the Vault Settings dialog box, select the Custom Objects tab and click Configure.
3. Choose an existing custom object definition.
4. Click Edit.
5. In the Security area, click the Configure... button.
6. Use the Add button to add existing users and groups to the list. Once the user or group is added to the list, select the user or group and modify the permission if needed.
7. Users and groups can be removed from the access control list by clicking Remove.

Security changes are applied immediately to all instances of the custom object definition.

### Numbering Schemes

# Numbering Schemes

Numbering Schemes let you configure how files, items, and change orders are named when they are added to a vault.

Note: This feature is available in Autodesk Vault Professional.

You can select from three existing schemes or you can create custom numbering schemes using one or more parameters. Item numbers are generated based on the user-defined properties mapped to the Number system property in the Property Definitions dialog. User-defined propertyy mappings will take precedence over numbering schemes when creating Items.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| *Mapped* | Item number free text scheme. |
| *Sequential* | File or Item names are generated sequentially. This is the default number scheme and cannot be edited or deleted. |
| *ECO* | Change Order names are generated based on a defined fixed text, a delimiter, and an auto-generated number. |
| *Custom* | Object names are generated based on a custom design. This feature provides the flexibility to create a numbering scheme where the name carries information about the object. |

## Numbering field essentials

Each separate part in a file number is called a field. There are five basic fields:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | *Example* | *Description* |
| *Auto-generated* | 1001, 1002, 1003 | Creates a sequential file number automatically each time an object is created. No user input is required. |
| *Delimiter* | - | A single character, such as a dash that separates each field. |
| *Fixed Text* | 2004 | Use this for a value you do not want changed and want to have in each object number. |
| *Free Text* | prototype | Creates a free form field so users can enter additional information |
| *Pre-defined List* | blue, yellow, green | Provides a list of choices to the user each time an object is created. |
| *Workgroup Label* | WG1 | The workgroup ID for the workgroup in which the number is generated. |

## Numbering Generator

There are tree types of number generators:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| *Simple Number Generator* | It produces numbers based on the other information provided in the numbering scheme. |
| *Centralized Number Generator* | It avoids duplicated generated number at the same time in a replicated environment. |
| *Custom Generator* | User specified numbering generators configured on the Vault server. |

## General numbering scheme rules

* Only one auto-generated field per numbering scheme sequence is allowed.

#### Defining Fields for Numbering Schemes

# Defining Fields for Numbering Schemes

The field type selected in the Add Field dialog box determines the available field settings. The default choice is Auto-generated Sequence.

## Auto-generated Sequence Settings

* Use to Name text box to give a name to the auto-generated field.
* The length determines the number the size of the range field and must be a positive value.
* The range specifies the beginning and end of the auto-generated number. The lower most limit must be less than the upper most limit.
* StepSize controls how the auto-generated number is incremented.

## Delimiter

* The value must be a character. The delimiter is used to separate fields.

## Fixed Text

* Use the Name text box to give a name to the fixed text field.
* The value entered in the Fixed Text field always displays in the file number and cannot be modified by the user.

## Free Text

* Use the Name text box to give a name to the free text field.
* Max Length controls the maximum number of characters allowed for this field.
* Max Length required forces user to enter the number of characters specified in the Max Length field. The number length cannot be over 50.
* When free text is used with an auto numbering scheme, the numbering only increments if the free text is identical. If the free text changes, then the auto number resets to the first number in the series.

  For example, if an auto-numbering scheme is set to 1-100 with a free text entry, and a file is renamed using the scheme, the auto number will reset to 1 unless the free text remains the same. For instance, is a file named 1-file.txt is renamed as <autonumber>-new-name.txt, it will become 1-new-name.txt.

## Predefined List

* Use the Name text box to give a name to the predefined list field.
* Specify a list of values in the Code field. You can optionally enter a description for each of the values.
* Use the Move up and Move down buttons to change the order of the values.
* Use the Delete button to remove a value.

## Workgroup label

* Selecting this option automatically assigns the workgroup label as a fixed value in the numbering scheme.

## Unrecognized characters

* The following characters are not acceptable in file or item names: **`" / ? < > \ * | :`**

#### Preview Numbering Schemes

# Preview Numbering Schemes

The New Numbering scheme dialog box and the Edit Numbering Scheme dialog box allow you to review and edit a numbering scheme.

* The name displays in the Name field. The name of the numbering scheme cannot be modified.
* The Preview field displays all fields defined. A field requiring user input is displayed as a question mark (?). Auto-generated fields are displayed as a pound sign (#).
* The Number Length field shows the maximum possible file number length.
* Use the Move up and Move down buttons to change the order of the values.
* Use the Edit, Delete and New buttons to modify the numbering scheme.
* Force letters to uppers case by selecting the Force to uppercase check box.

#### Visualization Management

# Visualization Management

The Visualization Management options let you specify which commands break the link between a data file in the vault and its corresponding visualization file.

When an operation causes a file to be versioned forward, the link to the visualization file is removed, preventing an out-of-date visualization file from being attached to the data file.

By default, the following commands remove the link to the visualization file:

* Copy Design
* Check In
* Edit Properties
* Modify Attachments
* Move
* Move Folder
* Rename
* Rename Folder
* Replace

If the option for a command to remove the link is turned off, then when that command is performed, the Visualization Compliance property for the data file is set to Not Synchronized to indicate that the visualization file attached to the data file is out-of-date and may not accurately represent the contents of the data file. When the data file is viewed, you are warned that the visualization file is not synchronized. You can either update the visualization file or manually verify that the visualization file is correct. When a visualization file is verified, the Visualization Compliance property for the data file is set to User Verified.

Visualization Management

1. Click Tools > Administration > Vault Settings.
2. In the Vault Settings dialog, click the **Visualization** tab.
3. Click **Commands**.
4. The Commands dialog lists the commands that cause a new version of a data file to be created. By default, all of the commands are set to remove the link between the data file and its corresponding visualization file. Turn off the check box next to a command to retain the link to the visualization file when the command is performed, but change the Visualization Compliance property to Not Synchronized.

Note: As a best practice, it is recommended that the default settings be used to prevent outdated visualization files from being attached to data files. Use the Update command to publish and attach a new visualization file.

### Category Administration

# Category Administration

Category management is the process of customizing categories and rules for grouping project data logically. Grouping by category lets you automatically assign a defined set of behaviors and rules to objects.

Note: This feature is available in Vault Professional.

A category labels Vault data and can assign user defined properties to all data in the Vault. Categories assigned to Vault data can also assign lifecycle definitions and revision schemes.

Files, folders, custom objects, and items do not necessarily have to be assigned to a category. Data that are not assigned to a category use the default behaviors defined for the vault.

**Default Category Assignment**

Any object that is not specifically assigned to a category will be assigned to the default category determined for that entity class. All objects will always be assigned to a category as there is a default for files, folders, custom objects, and items.

**Category Configuration**

A category has associated properties and behaviors that are applied to an object when it is assigned to the category. Those behaviors are of three types:

* Life cycles (files, folders, items, and custom objects)
* Revisions (files and items)
* User Defined Properties (files, folders, custom objects, and items)

## Create and Manage Categories

In the Vault Settings dialog box the **Behaviors** tab provides category management options. You can create and manage categories, category behaviors, and assignment rules.

You must be an administrator to use this feature.

#### Assigning Categories

# Assigning Categories

Learn about assigning categories to files, folders, custom objects, and items.

Rules govern which categories are assigned to a file, folder, custom object, or item. These are referred to as assignment rules. Assignment rules are used to automate category assignment to files, folders, custom objects, and items in a vault. Category assignment is determined by rules that the user sets up in the Rule Condition Builder. Use this builder to set conditions based on properties of the object.

### Lifecycle Definition Administration

# Lifecycle Definition Administration

Learn about how to make lifecycles work for your design environment.

A lifecycle definition is an engine that can be configured to automatically assign security, behaviors, and properties to Vault objects based on where the object is in the life of the design process. This functionality allows you to streamline your work environment by removing the overhead involved in managing groups of files, custom objects, or an entire project.

A lifecycle definition uses states to identify the object's status in the lifecycle. Examples of states are Work in Progress, For Review, or Released. An object moves from one state to another based on the lifecycle definition's transition rules. These transition rules determine when the state change happens, if it can occur manually or automatically (or both), based on criteria determined by the administrator. The lifecycle definition also determines if any other automatic behaviors occur based on a state change.

For example, a lifecycle definition can be configured to automatically revise a file when it moves from a Work in Progress state to a Review state. Or if a user changes a folder's status to obsolete, the lifecycle definition can automatically apply security settings to the folder so that only an administrator can modify the folder and its contents or reinstate it for use.

Note: You must have administrative access to perform these tasks.

Lifecycles can be used with files, project folders, items, and custom objects.

Several lifecycle definitions are included with the "out-of-the-box" install. These definitions will assist administrators in assigning definitions to Vault content without having to create them.

| **Lifecycle Definition** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| Basic Release Process | Basic manufacturing lifecycle process for release control. This definition can be used with most manufacturing project content. |
| Item Release Process | Basic item lifecycle process for release control. This definition can be used with all items and includes the following states:   * Work in Progress * In Review * Released * Quick-Change * Obsolete |
| Flexible Release Process | Flexible manufacturing life cycle process for release control. This definition includes all of the Basic Release Process states as well as a Quick Change state for editing released data. |
| Long Lead Time Release Process | Best suited for long lead time manufacturing projects. This definition includes a pre-release state indicating that the project data has been sent to manufacturing but is still in a state of change. |
| Design Representation Process | All files created for document control are automatically assigned to the Design Representation category. A dedicated category allows administrators to manage their rules, lifecycles, and properties independent of the associated design files. |
| Long Lead Time Release Process with Change Order | Best suited for long lead time manufacturing projects directed by change orders. This definition includes a work in progress, review, and pre-release state. The pre-release state indicates that a file has been sent to manufacturing but is still in a state of change. When there are no more change orders for the file, it moves to a released state. From there the file can return to the pre-release state through a quick-change. |
| <None> | This definition allows any category to assign a null definition to opt out of using a lifecycle definition but to still retain category behavior. |
| Simple Release Process | A generic lifecycle process for many different types of project data. This definition consists of a Work in Progress state and a Released state. |

The Lifecycle Definitions are located in the [Vault Settings dialog](GUID-981E31C8-F303-4F6D-B6E0-12C19C7ADD6F.htm) in the Behaviors tab.

#### Create a Lifecycle Definition

# Create a Lifecycle Definition

Create and configure lifecycle definitions on the Lifecycle Definition dialog.

1. Click **Tools > Administration > Vault Settings.**
2. On the Vault Settings dialog box, select the **Behaviors** tab > **Lifecycles.**
3. Click New to launch the Lifecycle Definition - New Definition dialog.
4. Enter a lifecycle definition name in the Definition Name field.
5. Select the categories to which you want the lifecycle definition assigned from the Category list. The category field is separated into entity types because the lifecycle definition can be assigned to multiple categories and multiple entity types (i.e., files, folders, items, and custom objects).
6. Enter a description for the new lifecycle definition in the Description field.
7. Select your preferred Definition Security from the drop-down:

   * **Combine with object-based security**–any state-based security defined for individual states within this lifecycle definition combine with the object-based security set on the object. In other words, the combined security becomes the effective security for the entity.
   * **Override object-based security**–any state-based security defined for individual states within this lifecycle definition override the object-based security set on the object. In other words, state-based security becomes the effective security for the entity.

   Note: Vaults migrated from Vault 2016 or earlier use Override object-based security as the default setting so that legacy (single-gate) security is maintained. However, all new vaults use Combine with object-based as the default security setting, which is a dual-gate security setting. Change this setting at any time to mimic legacy (single-gate) security.
8. Click the Plus (+) button to [create a lifecycle state](Edit-a-Lifecycle-State.htm) for the new definition.
9. After you have created your lifecycle states, select a lifecycle state in the Lifecycle Details list and click the checkmark to set it as the default state for the lifecycle definition.
10. Reorder lifecycle states by selecting a state in the Lifecycle Details view and clicking the up or down arrow. The order of the lifecycle states determines the order in which they are displayed in the Change State dialog.
11. When finished, click OK to save the new definition.

#### Lifecycle State Administration

# Lifecycle State Administration

Learn about creating and customizing lifecycle states.

Note: This feature is available only in Autodesk Vault Professional.

A lifecycle state represents a certain point in the lifecycle of vault data. Common lifecycle states include work-in-progress, review, and released.

You can customize individual state behavior for [lifecycle definitions](GUID-088F0236-B5B7-4E35-B218-BD2D253B87F6.htm) by performing any of these tasks:

* Customize a [state name and description](GUID-DE2FF897-0B67-4513-8D70-AC428B7C0132.htm)
* Modify [transition rules](GUID-B4443A39-A621-4E14-8A11-484EFBF3DB90.htm)
* Configure [member security](GUID-EEC9F632-6ED8-4671-8487-69436A0E1AD0.htm)
* Determine [purge criteria](GUID-02294D64-9ACA-4546-956E-095D9D7814B1.htm)
* Edit [comments](GUID-1625AB3D-3F2F-4823-B120-268FC6A3713E.htm) regarding state behavior

Note: All PDF files created for document control are automatically assigned to the Design Representation category. A dedicated category allows administrators to manage their rules, lifecycles, and properties independent of the associated design files.

For syncing State and maintaining Lifecycle Definition at Design Representation Process, PDF file will sync accordingly to the following cases:

* Sync State to Released State transition on a drawing file results in Released State on a PDF file.
* Sync State to Obsolete state transition on a drawing file results in Obsolete State on a PDF file.
* Sync State to Any other State transition on a drawing file results in Work in Progress State on a PDF file.

  Note: This automatically changes the state of the PDF file when the source file is transitioned to any other state.
* Sync State to Any other State transition on a drawing file results in Custom Lifecycle State on a PDF file.

##### Edit Lifecycle State Transitions

# Edit Lifecycle State Transitions

Configure transition criteria for an object in a certain lifecycle state to move to a new lifecycle state. You can also determine actions that are automatically triggered by the state change.

Note: This feature is available in Autodesk Vault Professional.

When an object moves from one lifecycle state to the next, it is called a transition. For example, when a file in Work-in-Progress state is changed to a Released state, that is a state transition.

For each state transition in a lifecycle, you can configure the:

* **Transition Criteria**–Configure the property criteria that determines when a state transition can occur. For example, administrators can make it so that a file cannot transition to the next state without the Initial Approver property having a value.
* **Actions that occur when the transition is made**–Configure which events automatically take place when a successful transition occurs. For example, if a file moves to a new state, an automatic revision bump occurs.
* **Access control permissions**– Determine the groups or users that can execute a transition.
* **Release Restrictions**– From the Transitions tab on the Lifecycle Definition dialog, you can see the available transitions between each state and edit the settings for each transition.

## Access Lifecycle State Transitions

1. Click **Tools > Administration > Vault Settings.**
2. On the Vault Settings dialog, click **Behaviors** tab > Lifecycles.
3. In the Lifecycle Definition dialog, select the name of the lifecycle definition for which you want to configure state transitions and click **Edit**. The selected definition name appears in the title bar.
4. From the Lifecycle States list, select the lifecycle state to edit and click the Transitions tab.
5. On the Transitions tab, the state transitions are listed in the From State and To State columns. Select the transition that you want to modify and click **Edit.**

   There are three options in the Transition dialog: Criteria, Actions, and Security.

## Configure Transition Criteria

Use transition criteria to determine when a transition occurs. The transition will not happen until the criteria is met.

### Add Transition Criteria

1. In the Transition dialog, select the **Criteria** tab. On the Criteria tab, define the criteria under which the transition can occur:

   1. If desired, filter which properties are displayed based on a certain entity class. For example, configure it so that only File Properties are shown in the Property drop-down.
   2. In the Property field, select the property.
   3. In the Condition field, select the condition.
   4. When appropriate, select a value from the Value field. Not all criterion definitions require an entry to the Value field.
2. Click **Add.** The rule is added to the list in the text box below the Add button.

Tip: Use the Property Compliance property to ensure that all properties are in compliance before the transition can take place. This is an excellent rule to incorporate when configuring a transition from non-released state to a released state.

### Remove or Replace Transition Criteria

1. On the Transitions tab, select the transition that you want to modify and click **Edit.**
2. On the Transition dialog, select the Criteria tab, and then do one of the following:

   * Select the defined criterion from the text box, and click **Remove.**
   * Select the defined criterion from the text box, select new criteria from the Property, Condition, and Value boxes and click **Replace.**

**Boolean Operators (case insensitive)**

You can use the following boolean operators when defining the transition criteria value.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| and | Criteria includes x AND y. |
| or | Criteria includes either x OR y. |
| not | Criteria includes documents that do NOT have x. |

## Edit Transition Actions

Transition actions are events that occur when the transition is successful. If any error occurs during the transition to the next state, the action will not take place.

### Access the Transitions tab

1. In the **Transitions** dialog, click the **Actions** tab.
2. Select an entity class in the Filter drop-down to show only the actions available for that entity class (e.g., select Folders to only see actions available for folder state transitions).

### Bump Revision

1. If you want a revision bump to occur when the transition occurs, select one of these actions:

   * Bump primary revision
   * Bump secondary revision
   * Bump tertiary revision

   Note: Use-the drop-down arrow beside Bump Primary Revision to choose secondary or tertiary revision levels.

   Or clear the check box to exclude the action for this transition.

### Synchronize Properties

1. If you want to synchronize properties with the Job Server,

   * Select Synchronize properties and update the selected file types using Job Server.
   * Click on the ellipses (...) button and select the file type.

   Or clear the check box to exclude the action for this transition.

### Release Restrictions

The administrator can choose to restrict the transition to the release state of Vault objects based on the state of the dependent children, content, and linked data. Any data that is not in a released (consumable) state causes a restriction and prevents the transition of the select object(s).

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Check that dependent child files are released | Verifies that state dependent children are in a released state. |
| Check that dependent child folders are released | Verifies that the sub-folders of a project folder are in a released state. |
| Check that contained files are released | Verifies that all files contained in a project folder are in a released state. |
| Check that linked files are released | Verifies that all linked files in a project folder or custom object are in a released state. |
| Check that linked folders are released | Verifies that all linked folders in a project folder or custom object are in a released state. |
| Check that linked custom objects are released | Verifies that all linked custom objects in a project or custom object are in a released state. |
| Check that linked items are released | Verifies that all linked items in a project folder or custom object are in a released state. |
| Check that children are not obsolete | Verifies that children objects are not in an obsolete state. The parent will not be released if any child items are obsolete. |
| Check that child items are released | Verifies that children items are in a released state. |
| Check that child items have been released | Verify that child items have a historically released revision. |
| Check that associated item file links are up to date | Verifies that all associated item file links are current.  Click the ellipses (...) button to specify only certain item file links:   * Primary File Links * Secondary File Links * Standard Component Links * Primary Subcomponent File Links * Secondary Subcomponent File Links * Design Documents |
| Check that associated item file links are released | Verifies that all associated item file links are in a released state.  Click the ellipses (...) button to specify only certain item file links:   * Primary File Links * Secondary File Links * Standard Component Links * Primary Subcomponent File Links * Secondary Subcomponent File Links * Design Documents |

### Purge

If you want to enable purge for files and items during the state transition, select the Purge action. All files, folders, and items changed during the corresponding state change will be purged using the server selective purge task.

### Sync Item to Fusion Manage using Vault Connector

Select this action to enable automated synchronization for Items during a state transition. Once an Item is moved into the corresponding state, it will be automatically queued and synced to Fusion Manage by the Vault Connector Agent.

## Create a Custom Job

Associate a custom job with a lifecycle transition. Two steps are necessary to create a custom job. First, an administrator adds a custom job to a lifecycle. Second, a programmer creates the job.

More information: [Create a Custom Job](GUID-DD071BFB-45AC-4157-9660-2370EFA9B844.htm)

## Edit Transition Security

Determine who can make a transition occur by configuring Transition Security. Anyone with Modify access can invoke the Change State command on the object.

Tip: There is currently no command to retire a state. However, you can manually retire a state by denying everyone permission to perform a transition. This prevents files in other states from transitioning into that state. However, files can still transition out of the blocked state into a new one.

### Manage Transition Restrictions

1. In the Transitions dialog, click the **Security** tab.
2. When the **No restrictions on the transition** check box is selected, no security options can be defined for the transition. To add transition restrictions, clear the No restrictions on the transition check box if it is selected. Click **Add**.

### Add Members

Members or groups must be made available, and then added to the Current Members list to enable transition permission.

1. In the Add Members dialog, select members or groups from the **Select Members From** list to be added to the Available Members list.
2. In the **Available Members** list, select members or groups to be added to the Current Members list, and then click **Add.**

### Remove Members

* In the Add Members dialog, select members or groups in the Current Members list, and then click **Remove.**

### Modify Permissions on Existing Members

Important: Users must have Modify permission at the object-based security level to perform a change state.

* In the Add Members dialog, select the permission next to the member for whom you want to Allow or Deny access and select the new permission from the drop-down list.

## Configure Peer Review Control

Set a peer review on a file during a state transition. The controlling mechanism checks whether the current user is not the same user who has executed the previous state change.

For example, when transitioning a file from Work in Progress state to a Released state, the user who is working on the file in the Work in Progress state can't move the file to Released state.

Under the peer review control, you can define multiple transition criteria determining when a state transition can occur. Once the criteria are met, the system checks the user in the 'From' and 'To' states. The user who set the file in the 'From' state of the transition won't be able to change the state to the 'To' state. This functionality can be used to facilitate delegation of authority and increase transparency.

Note:

* Peer review check can only be applied on files and works within one lifecycle.
* All rules in a rule set are run in priority order from top to bottom.

### Add Rules

1. In the Transitions dialog, click the **Peer Review** tab.
2. On the Peer Review tab, define the rule under which the state change can occur. A rule can include multiple criteria.

   * In the Rule Name field, define the rule name.
   * In the Property field, select the property.
   * In the Condition field, select the condition.
   * When appropriate, select a value from the Value field. Not all criterion definitions require an entry to the Value field.
3. Click **Add**. The rule is added to the Rule Criteria field.

   You can add multiple criteria to a rule. Once all the criteria are added, click OK.

Tip: Use the Property Compliance property to ensure that all properties comply before the transition can take place. This is an excellent rule to incorporate when configuring a transition from a non-released state to a released state.

### Remove Rules

1. On the Transitions tab, select the transition that you want to modify and click **Edit**.
2. On the Transition dialog, select the **Peer Review** tab.
3. Select the defined rule from the text box, and click **Remove**.

##### Edit Lifecycle State Security

# Edit Lifecycle State Security

Control which members and groups can read, modify, or delete an object assigned to a state from the Security tab of the Lifecycle Definition dialog box.

Note: This feature is available in Autodesk Vault Professional.

## Using State-Based Security

There are three ways to define the security of an object:

* **Object-based security–** security is derived from the object settings. This is the default option.

  Note: Items do not have object-based security.
* **State-based security–** available when a state-based ACL exists and is combined with object-based security.
* **Overridden security–** available when a state-based ACL is overriding object-based security, or when the administrator sets a manual override on the object.

Note: See [File, Folder, and Custom Object Security](GUID-07AB6615-AFDD-4C86-96DE-A3D334AF454B.htm) and [Access Control Lists](GUID-37BD99E4-1189-4383-8531-92B607D74873.htm) for more information about how security and permissions work.

State-based security is either combined with object-based security or overrides object-based security, based on the [Definition Security](GUID-92A079F0-65A6-4FB5-B4DC-853DD6539445.htm) defined for the lifecycle definition.

## Define State-Based Security

### Access Security for a Lifecycle State

### Vault Revision Table Administration

# Vault Revision Table Administration

The Vault Revision Table feature allows you to automatically update a drawing's revision table with Vault data when properties are synchronized through the [Job Server](GUID-41C25A0B-81DC-4E5B-B98B-3EA7B280CD97.htm). Administrators can configure the information to be displayed in the drawings' revision table for standardization across the vault through the Revision Table Settings.

This functionality eliminates the need to open each drawing within its native CAD application for updates.

Important: The Vault Revision Table feature must be enabled before you can configure Revision table settings or use the Revision Table feature in the Inventor and AutoCAD Vault add-ins.

## Supported Drawings

* AutoCAD drawings (.dwg)
* AutoCAD Mechanical drawings (.dwg)
* Autodesk Inventor drawings (.idw)
* Autodesk Inventor drawings (.dwg)

## Pre-requisites

Important: You must be an [administrator](GUID-269FDA08-F0C0-47E8-92DA-D832E03F827A.htm) to enable the Vault Revision Table.

Note: The system property 'Revision' is a key mapping and be must be mapped to at least one of the column headers.

* Autodesk Inventor is installed so that Inventor IDW and DWG drawings can be updated.
* Revision Table functionality is enabled.
* The Job Server is enabled with the synchronize properties option selected for the required state transition(s).
* Suitable column headers are created and their property mappings established between the drawings' revision table columns and the Vault properties.

Once all pre-requisites are met, the revision tables for the supported drawings are automatically updated with specified Vault data whenever properties are synchronized with the Job Server. This way, you can be sure that the revision table within your drawing is always up-to-date with the appropriate information from the vault.

**Revision Table Settings Dialog (full-view)**

| *Feature* | *Details* |
| --- | --- |
|  | Load suggested settings |
|  | Loads the default settings for the dialog. |
|  | Restores all changes in the Revision Table settings dialog to the settings used the last time the dialog was opened. |
|  | |
| *Mappings Tab* | On the Mappings tab, you can map Vault Properties to the Revision Table columns. |
| Column Header | Column name that displays in the revision table. |
| Vault Properties | The name of the Vault property that you have mapped to the associated revision table column.  The value for this property will automatically appear in the column field in the revision table for the drawing. |
|  | Released vs. non-released bias control.  Select the check box for any row where you want the system to update the revision table with released only information. If the check box for a row is not selected, then the latest information from the vault is used. |
|  | |
| *Content Tab* | On the Content tab, you can enforce the type of information that is displayed in the revision table. |
| Update rows using... | Select versions control.  Select the version and the released state that you want to apply to revision history records. |
| Limit number of rows check box | If you want to limit the number of rows displayed in the revision table, select the Limit number of rows check box. Specify the limit for the number of rows that you want displayed by selected a value from the value spinner.  Note: When the Limit number of rows option is turned ON, the exceeding records are deleted by default. In Inventor drawings, you can also choose to hide these exceeding records instead of deleting them. |
| Hide exceeding records for Inventor drawings check box | Select this check box to hide instead of delete additional Inventor drawings records. |
| Update latest revision only | Select this check box to update the mapped values only for the latest revision row within the revision table. All other mapped values in previous historical revision rows will not be updated even if the data is non-equivalent in the vault .  Note: Even with the Update latest revision only enabled, the Vault Revision Table feature will continue to remove revision rows which are not found in the Vault. |
| Detect revision scheme change and remove previous revision history | If you are using multiple revision schemes, select this check box to ensure that the current revision scheme is used. Historical revision rows of an older revision scheme are replaced with the current revision scheme. |
|  | |
| *Filters Tab* | On the Filters tab, you can further refine the data displayed in the revision table by applying revision level filters. |
| Display revision at the following levels | Select the check box for each revision level that you want displayed in the revision table. For example, if you have a drawing marked as revision B.2.1, and you only select the Primary and Secondary check boxes, then only B.2 will display in the revision table.  Refer to [Revision Schemes](Revision-Scheme-Administration.htm) for more information about Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary revision levels. |
| Apply precedence rules to display only X revision levels | When multiple revision levels exist within a revision group, it is necessary to identify which level of revision that you want displayed. Enable this check box and select whether you want the highest or lowest revision levels displayed in the revision table.  This selection takes precedence over the Display revision at the following levels option. |
| Omit the initial revision row | Select this check box to omit the initial revision row from the revision table.  Some users find that if the initial revision value (e.g.,-a) is already in the title block for the revision table, having it repeated as the first revision row is unnecessary. By selecting this check box, the first revision row in the revision table becomes the next revision value (e.g.,-a.1) . |

### Map Vault Properties to Revision Table Columns

1. On the **Revision Table Settings** dialog, select the **Mappings** tab.
2. Click on a blank field under **Column Header** and enter a value to create a column heading for the revision table.
3. Click on the corresponding field in the **Vault Properties** column and select the property that you want to map to the Column Header from the drop-down list.

   Note: The system property 'Revision' is a key mapping and must be mapped to at least one of the column headers.
4. Select the check box in the released bias control column if you want only released values for the assigned property to display in the revision table. Clear this check box if you want the latest value for the property to display instead.
5. Repeat the last three steps for additional entries.
6. Click **OK** to save your settings.

### Configure Whether the First or Last Version of a Revision Value is Used

When working with revisions, it is possible to have multiple versions of a drawing within one revision. You can determine whether you want the first version of the revision or the last version of the revision's data displayed in the revision table on the Content tab.

1. On the Revision Table Settings dialog, select the Content tab.
2. In the Update rows using line, select whether you want to display values for the first or last version of the revision.
3. On the next line, select whether or not you want the first or last version values for released state information.
4. Click OK to save your settings.

### Limit the Number of Rows in the Revision Table

You can enforce how many revision rows are displayed in a revision table by enforcing a limit on the number of rows. Additionally, you can identify just how many rows you want the limit to be.

1. On the **Revision Table Settings** dialog, select the **Content** tab.
2. Select the **Limit number of rows** check box.
3. Identify how many rows the revision table is limited to displaying by entering a value or using the up and down arrows to change the current value.

   Note: When the **Limit number of rows** option is turned ON, the exceeding records are deleted by default. In Inventor drawings, you can also choose to hide these exceeding records instead of deleting them.
4. Click **OK** to save your settings.

### Update Latest Revision Row

1. On the **Revision Table Settings** dialog, select the **Content** tab.
2. Enable the **Update latest revision only** check box to update the mapped values only for the latest revision row within the revision table. All other mapped values in previous historical revision rows will not be updated even if the data is non-equivalent in the vault .

   Note: Even with the Update latest revision only enabled, the Vault Revision Table feature will continue to remove revision rows which are not found in the Vault.
3. Click **OK** to save your settings.

### Detect Revision Scheme Change

If you are using multiple revision schemes, you can ensure that the current revision scheme is used instead of historical revision data.

1. On the **Revision Table Settings** dialog, select the **Content** tab.
2. Select the **Detect revision scheme change and remove previous revision history** check box to replace historical revision rows with the current revision scheme information.
3. Click **OK** to save your settings.

### Configure the Revision Levels that are Displayed

You can control how many revision levels are shown in the revision table. For example, if you use tertiary revision levels (e.g.,-b.2.1), you can determine whether just the B shows, the B.2, or all three levels (B.2.1).

1. On the **Revision Table Settings** dialog, select the **Filters** tab.
2. Select check box for each revision level that you want displayed in the revision table.
3. When multiple revision levels exist within a revision group, it is necessary to identify which level of revision that you want displayed. Enable the **Apply precedence rules...** check box and select whether you want the highest or lowest revision levels displayed in the revision table.

   Note: This selection takes precedence over the Display revision at the following levels option.
4. Click **OK** to save your settings.

### Omit the Initial Revision Row

Some users find that if the initial revision value (e.g.,-a) is already in the title block for the revision table, having it repeated as the first revision row is unnecessary. You can configure the revision tables to omit the first revision value and start the first row with the next revision value(e.g, A.1).

1. On the **Revision Table Settings** dialog, select the **Filters** tab.
2. Select the **Omit the initial revision row** check box.
3. Click **OK** to save your settings.

## Update the Vault Revision Table with Synchronize Properties

There resides a XML config file in the vault installation directory (C:\Program Files\Autodesk\Vault Client <year>\Explorer\Connectivity.VaultPro.dll.config) which contains the following tag

```
<add key="UpdateRevBlockOnSyncProp" value="0"/>
```

. This tag has the value set at **0** by default. Changing this value to **1** enables the updating of the Vault Revision Table during a user triggered Synchronize Properties operation within the Vault client.

## Update the Vault Revision Table on Legacy Inventor Drawings

### Update with the Vault client

By default, drawings that are previously saved using an older Inventor install will not be updated by the Vault Revision Table feature within the Vault client.

However you can allow the Vault Revision Table of these Inventor drawings to be updated through tag

```
<add key="UpdateRevBlockMigrateLatestINV" value="0"/>
```

found in the XML config file within the vault installation directory (C:\Program Files\Autodesk\Vault Client <year>\Explorer\Connectivity.VaultPro.dll.config).

### Configure Vault Connector Mappings

# Configure Vault Connector Mappings

After enabling the connector, an administrator must configure the mapping settings within the Vault Client. This involves selecting the target Fusion Manage workspace and defining how Vault Item properties correspond to the properties in Fusion Manage.

### Prerequisites:

* The Vault Connector must be enabled in the ADMS Console.
* You must have a revision-controlled workspace in Fusion Manage designated for the sync.
* A Fusion Manage out-of-the-box Items workspace (previously known as Items and BOMs) is to be used for the integration.
* Vault Items must be in use since the connector will synchronize with FM at the Item level.
* Additional Property mapping between Fusion Manage and Vault Items, if any. (Other than out-of-the-box)
* The target Fusion Manage workspace **must** contain the following system properties. These are essential for the connector to function correctly:
  + `IMAGE`
  + `PDM_SOURCE_TYPE`
  + `PDM_SOURCE_ID`
  + `PDM_ITEM_ID`
  + `PDM_ITEM_VERSION`
  + `PDM_MASTER_ID`
  + `PDM_SOURCE_NAME`
  + `PDM_VAULT_NAME`
  + `SOURCE`
* Only roles with these permissions in both Vault and Fusion Manage will be able to configure these mappings:
  + **"Vault Option Set / Get"** in Vault.
  + **Read / Write Permissions** to the Fusion Manage Workspace.

### Default Mappings

Out of the box, the Vault Connector provides the following default property mappings to serve as a recommended starting point for your configuration.

| Vault Property | Fusion Manage Property | Entity Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Title (Item, CO) | Title | Item |
| Description (Item, CO) | Description | Item |
| Category Name | PDM Category | Item |
| Date Modified | PDM Last Modification Date | Item |
| Last Updated By | Responsible Designer | Item |
| Units | PDM\_UNIT\_OF\_MEASURE | Item |
| Material | Material | Item |
| BOMOrder | Row Order | BOM |
| QuantityNumber | Qty Pos | BOM |

### Properties Administration

# Properties Administration

Property Administration includes tasks to create and manage property definitions. You must have administrative access to perform these tasks.

Properties are attributes associated with a file. Vault recognizes two types of property definitions: system-defined properties and user-defined properties (UDPs). System-defined properties are those that are derived from the vault. The vault has a global set of properties that are applied to files in the vault. User-defined properties are created by using the administrative tools.

Before working with properties, it is important to become familiar with the terms, data types, and attributes associated with the Vault properties system.

## Common Terms

The following table contains terms commonly used with properties.

| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Associations | Attribute that determines for which entities classes the property is available. |
| Compliant | The status of a property that meets all property policies and equivalence evaluations. |
| Data Type | The type of data accepted for the property value. This type can be text, number, boolean, or date. |
| Database Property | Any property in the database, either user defined or system. |
| Entity | An entity is the system class with which a file can be associated. Entities are files, folders, items, or change orders. |
| Equivalent | The status of a mapped property when its value matches the source value. |
| File Property | A property associated with a file. |
| Mapped Property | A property from which the propriety being defined gets its value. For example, a UDP can get its value from several different file properties. A file property can get its value from a system property. |
| Mapping | A set of relationships between the property being defined and a property from which it receives its value. There can be multiple mappings for a given property definition. |
| Master | The property from which a mapped property gets its value. The master property writes its value to the subordinate property. |
| Non-compliant | The status of a property when it has failed to meet one or more property policies or its equivalence evaluation. |
| Non-equivalent | The status of a mapped property when its value does not match the source value. |
| Property Definition | All attributes and constraints about the property including its name, data type, initial value, mapping, minimum and maximum values, case values, in-use value, and basic search value. |
| Property Name | The name used in the GUI (graphical user interface) to identify the property. |
| Property Policy | Depending on the data type, the property policy specifies certain constraints that must be met. The constraints may include a value range, a value type, or a value format must be met. For example, a property policy might be described as follows: the property must have a value and that value must be in the range of 1 to 10. When a property fails to meet its property policies, it is considered non-compliant. |
| Property Value | The literal content of a property attribute for a specific file version. |
| Override | Determines whether the property value is overidden by the policy defined by its category. |
| Subordinate | The mapped property that receives its value from the master property. |
| System-Defined Property | A property in the database created by the system, which is then assigned to a file. |
| User-Defined Property (UDP) | A property in the database created by an administrator. The property can be applied to a file when it is added to a vault. |

## Data Types

Every property value has a data type that determines how that value is read and processed.

| Data Type Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Boolean | True or False. |
| Date Type | Can be a specific date or date range expressed by a beginning and end date. |
| Number | Numbers only. |
| Text | Letters and numbers. |

## Attributes

Properties have attributes that determine how the property is described and the constraints for its value.

| Attribute Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Basic Search | A constraint that determines whether or not the property should be included in basic searches. |
| Case Sensitivity | A constraint that applies to text data types. This constraint can be set to none, UPPER CASE, lower case, Name Case or Sentence case. |
| Enforce List of Values | A constraint that determines whether the property must have a value from a list. |
| Initial Value | An attribute that specifies the initial property value when one isn't specified. Note: Initial values are best used with write mappings. If an initial value is set on a regular read mapping, that read mapping has higher priority and will overwrite the initial value. The only case in which an initial value won't be overwritten by a read mapping is if the value it maps to is blank. |
| List Values | Displays the List Type dialog box from which you can enter and order values for a list. At least one item must appear in the list. |
| Minimum Length | The minimum number of characters a property value can have. |
| Maximum Length | The maximum number of characters a property value can have. |
| Requires Value | A constraint which determines whether the property must have a value to be compliant. |
| State | A setting on a property that indicates whether it recognizes the state the file in a lifecycle. |
| Usage | Indicates the number of files currently using the property. Use this information to determine which properties are used more than others, to help decide which properties can be removed from the vault. |

## Property Compliance Icons

The main view in the vault client has a Property Compliance column that lists various status icons. The Icons in this column indicate whether a property associated with the file is compliant, non-compliant, pending, or has failed the equivalence evaluation.

| Icon | Value | Definition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| No icon | Compliant | All properties meet policy requirements and equivalence. |
|  | Non-compliant | One or more properties do not meet property policy requirements or equivalence.  Hover your mouse over the icon to learn more about why one or more properties failed compliance. |
|  | Not calculated | There has been a change to one or more properties but equivalence and policy have not been verified yet. |
|  | Pending | Properties are currently being evaluated for equivalence. |
|  | Evaluation failed. | The equivalence evaluation failed. This is a rare situation and can result when the processor enters an evaluation loop.  *Note:* On the Find dialog, an evaluation failed value is added. This allows you to search for any files for which the evaluation failed. |

#### User-Defined Properties

# User-Defined Properties

Learn about how user-defined properties work in Vault.

When files are checked into the vault, only the properties that are set enabled are automatically extracted and indexed by default. All the extracted properties being tracked by the vault can be managed using the Property Definitions dialog box. The [Property Definitions dialog](GUID-8D5F5998-43A5-4813-B3E3-6CD4D12A4F67.htm) box lists:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| *Property Name* | The name of the property as it appears in the interface. The display name can be edited by the vault administrator. |
| *Data Type* | The type of data represented by the property. The data types are: text, number, date, and boolean. |
| *Usage* | Indicates the number of files currently using the property. Use this information to determine which properties are used more than others, to help decide which properties can be removed from the vault. |
| *State* | Indicates whether or not the property is enabled for indexing and visible to the user.   * *Enabled* If a property is set to Enabled, the property is indexed and extracted from files when they are added or checked into the vault. * *Disabled* If a property is set to Disabled, it is not indexed and it is not extracted from files when they are added or checked in to the vault. Administrators can clean up unwanted properties by marking them Disabled. |
| *Associations* | Lists the entity class that can use the property. Classes are change orders, custom objects, files, folders, items, and custom objects. In addition, UDPs may be associated with Bill of Materials Rows, Reference Designators, and Links between entities. |
| *File Categories* | If the property is associated with a file category, the category name is displayed. Category values will override property values if the property Override attribute is enabled. |
| *Item Categories* Note: This feature is available in Vault Professional. | If the property is associated with an item category, the category name is displayed. Category values will override property values if the property Override attribute is enabled. |
| *Folder Categories* | If the property is associated with a folder category, the category name is displayed. Category values override property values if the property override attribute is enabled. |
| *Custom Object Categories*  Note: This feature is available in Vault Professional. | If the property is associated with a custom object category, the category name is displayed. Category values override property values if the property override attribute is enabled. |
| *Basic Search* | Indicates if a string property is searched when using the basic search feature. The possible values are:  * Searched: the property is included in the basic search. * Not Searched: the property is excluded from the basic search. * No Allowed: the property is not a string value and therefore cannot be included in the basic search. |

**Important:** When a new user-defined property is created, it does not have to be associated with any categories. However, even if the property is associated with an entity (file, folder,custom object, change order, item, etc.) and is not associated with any categories, it will not appear in the properties grid for that entity type.

When migrating an existing vault database, all existing properties set to Enabled are migrated. However, any new properties default to Disabled. To improve indexing performance, all properties without mappings are not created unless specified by the administrator.

## Renaming

The display name of a property can be edited to make it more meaningful. Both system-defined and user-defined names can be changed by selecting Edit on the Property Definitions dialog.

## Changing the State

The state of a property determines whether or not the property is included in the vault index.

You specify which properties to include in the vault by setting the state to Enabled. Marking properties Enabled lets administrators clean unused properties from the vault. When a property is not in use, it is no longer associated with any files and it is removed from the index. This makes searching more efficient overall because there are fewer properties. You cannot search on a property that is not in use. You cannot display an unused property as a column in a grid. You cannot map properties to unused file properties. Unused properties can be re-associated with files by changing the state back to Enabled and then using the server console to re-index the properties. For more information on re-indexing, see the Autodesk Server Console Help.

Note: Changing the state of properties requires that the vault be re-indexed using the server console. For more information on re-indexing a vault, see Autodesk Server Console Help.

## Examining Usage Count

The usage count of a property tells you how prevalent the property is throughout the vault. The number in the Usage column is the number of files with which the property is associated. When a property is Disabled, its usage count is set to 0.

To view the usage count of a property, select the Get Usage Counts button in the Property Definitions dialog.

## Specifying Searchable Properties

The Basic Search setting for a property determines whether or not that file property is available for searching when performing a basic search. The Basic Search setting applies only to the basic search and not to searches using the query builder or the Find dialog. Only string type file properties can be set to Searched.

String type file properties that are set to Searched are available for the basic search. Properties set to Not Searched are not currently available for the basic search. By setting unused file properties to Not Searched, you can increase search performance. Properties set to Not Allowed are not string type properties and are not available for the basic search. A property set to Not Allowed cannot be changed to any other setting.

When the state of a property is set to Disabled, the basic search setting is automatically set to Not Searched. If that property is later set to Enabled, the basic search setting remains Not Searched. In order for the property to be available for basic search, the administrator must manually set the property to Searched.

Note: All item and change order string type properties are set to searched and are always included in the basic search.

## Specifying user-defined properties as Hyperlink

The display of a property value can be edited to make it a hyperlink.

You can:

1. Select multiple files and choose any user-defined property with a Text data type. For example, “Description”.
2. Click on Edit Property on the Properties Panel.
3. The Property Edit dialog will be displayed.
4. Enter the property value and format each row to make it a hyperlink. The property value and format can be:

   | Value | Format |
   | --- | --- |
   | Link to help <https://help.autodesk.com/> | Link to help `https://help.autodesk.com/` |
   | Click here to open link | Click `[here](https://help.autodesk.com/)` to open link. |
   | [testemail@example.com](mailto:testemail@example.com) | `testemail@example.com` |
   | Send me email | Send me `[email](testemail@example.com)` |
5. Click OK.
6. The new values are saved. Click Close to return to the Main grid within Project Explorer.

You will be seeing the hyperlink in blue underlined text on the Main grid and on the Properties Panel.

Note: If the hyperlink text is cropped, hovering on the hyperlink will display the complete hyperlink. Pressing Ctrl+Click on the hyperlink will open it in your default browser or email provider.

#### User-Defined Property Associations

# User-Defined Property Associations

Associations define the entity classes that can use the user-defined property (UDP).

For example, if a UDP has an association of Change Order, then only change orders can use that UDP.

A UDP can also be associated with specific entity sub-classes. For example, a UDP can be created so that only Folders of type Project are able to use that UDP.

![](../images/menu-udp-associationslist.png)

If a new UDP is not associated with any entity classes, it will not appear in the properties grid for that entity.

| Association | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Bill of Materials Row | Use the Bills of Material (BOM) Row association to create a [custom BOM row property](Create-a-Bill-of-Materials-bom.htm).  Note:  Properties with a BOM association cannot be associated with any other properties. These properties can only be displayed in the BOM view. |
| Change Order | Use the change order association to create a custom change order property. |
| Custom Object | Use the custom object association to create a custom object property. The custom property may be restricted to a certain category type, such as Base. |
| File | Use the file property association to create a custom file property. The custom property may be restricted to files of a certain category type, such as Base or Engineering. |
| Folder | Use the folder association to create a custom folder property. The custom property may be restricted to a folder sub-class, such as a basic folder or project. |
| Item | Use the item association to create a custom item property. The custom property may be restricted to certain types of item sub-classes, such as a part or a document. |
| Link | A link is a reference between   * two defined custom object entities * a custom object and a file, folder, or item entity * a folder and a file, folder, or item entity.     The Link association is used to create a custom object link property to track link data between a custom object and another entity class.  Imported Factory property links show this link association as selected.  Note: The link properties are not accessible via Custom View in the Vault user Interface (lists and tabs). Administrators need to create a custom tab to be able to display link properties. |
| Reference Designator | A reference designator is a property that makes it easier for electrical users to view a BOM by indicating how an item is tagged, its location, or its installation information.  Use the reference designator association to create a custom reference designator property that can be displayed in the Reference Designator View. |

#### Create a User-Defined property

# Create a User-Defined property

Create new user-defined properties (UDP) to help customize property mapping and write back preferences.

You must have administrative access to perform these tasks.

1. Click Tools > Administration > Vault Settings.
2. On the Vault Settings dialog box Behaviors tab, click **Properties.**
3. In the property Definitions dialog box, click **New.**
4. In the New property dialog box, enter a name.
5. In the Type list, select the property type.
6. Assign the UDP to one or more categories by selecting the category check boxes in the Associations drop-down list. Categories can be pre-selected in this list based on the filter previously selected in the property Definitions dialog box. You can select or clear categories as needed.

   When a UDP is created, it does not have to be associated with any categories. However, if a new UDP is not associated with any categories, it will not appear in the properties grid for that entity.

   **Important:** A property will only appear with an entity (file, folder, custom object, item, change order) when the property is either in the same category or manually associated. To manually associate a property with a category, see Add or Remove property.

On the Settings tab, some property settings are populated with values determined by the Name and Type entries from the previous steps.

**Define List Values**

On the Settings tab, select the Initial Value row. Depending on the type of the property, the cell on the right becomes a modifiable field, a drop-down list with existing values, or a drop-down list with values you can add.

1. Perform one of these tasks:

   * If the property is type text, enter a value and proceed to the last step.
   * If the property is type boolean or date, select the appropriate value and proceed to the last step.
   * If the field is a drop-down list for which you can create values, Click (...) and proceed to the next step.
2. In the List property dialog pane, click in the List Values list enter a name for the new value. Continue to add values to complete the list.
3. Do any of the following:

   * Select a value in the list, and then select **Set as Default.** If you do not select a default list value, the last value entered becomes the default value.
   * Click **Add,** leave the Value blank, and then click **Set as Default** to begin the list with a blank value. The end user will then have the option of selecting nothing from the list.
   * Insert a new value anywhere in the list. Select a value and, then click **Add** to insert a blank value row above the selected value. Enter a name for the value.
   * Insert a new value anywhere in the list. Select a value and click **Add** to insert a blank value row above the selected value. Enter a name for the value.
   * Select a value and click **Remove** to remove the value from the list.
   * Select a value and click **Move Up** or **Move Down** as needed to arrange the order of the values in the list.
4. Click **OK** to close the List property dialog box and return to the New property dialog box.

#### Content Source Providers

# Content Source Providers

Learn about Content Source Providers and how they work with Vault.

Sometimes files share properties across different software application groups, also known as content providers. When a file from a supported content provider is created or migrated into a vault, the property name is appended with a marker to indicate from which application group the property was obtained. Since it is possible to have the same property from different application groups, the marker makes it easier to manage duplicate properties that you want to migrate or import into a vault. For example, you could have three author properties, one for each known application group:

* **Inventor and Inventor DWG**–Author(I)
* **AutoCAD**–Author(A)
* **Microsoft Office**–Author(standard)

if an author user-defined property was mapped to these three properties at the same time, then author(i) would take precedence as it is ranked higher on the mapping list.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Application Marker** | **Application Group** |
| (I) | Inventor iProperties (.iam, .dwg, .idw, .ipn, .ipt) |
| (A) | AutoCAD block attributes (.dwf, .dxt)  AutoCAD Electrical (.wdp) |
| (standard) | Standard structured storage properties (.doc, .dot, .pot, .ppt, .xls, .xlt, .docr, .dotx, .dotm, .docx, .potx, .potm, .pptm, .pptx, .xlsb, .xlsm, .xlxs) |
| N/A | File property is derived from an unknown source or does not support write back. |

**Parent page:** [Properties Administration](GUID-26645DD0-AC27-4CFB-BC15-41719B5DE609.htm)


#### Map Properties

# Map Properties

You can map properties to a user-defined property (UDP) so that values from the primary file, such as a file property, are written to the subordinate UDP.

Mapping priority determines the order in which properties are written to a vault object. If more than one property writes to a particular object, the highest ranking property takes precedence.

Note:

* When both file and item UDPs are mapped to the same file property, the item UDP takes precedence.
* Mapping Text with Number or Text with Date works well when all clients and the server are in the same language-locale. If mixed locales are used, values may convert in a manner that is not intuitive and may produce an undesirable result. Therefore, mapping Text with Number or Text with Date is only recommended when the server and all clients are set up to work in the same locale.
* For property mappings, some datatypes require the same client language. See [Plan Your Deployment](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-590CC16D-0CA4-47A2-AA4E-713B8116DEAC) for more details.

## Import and Export Mapping Configurations

There are two ways in which a file property is added to the vault:

* Certain file property definitions come with the client and are already included in the vault.
* Adding a file to the vault only captures new property definitions for the file if it is set to create. Otherwise, only property definitions already defined in the vault will be created for the file to reduce extraneous property definitions or duplicates.

### Access Property Mappings

1. Select **Tools > Administration > Vault Settings**.
2. In the **Vault Settings** dialog, click the **Behaviors** tab.
3. In the **Properties** section, click **Properties**.
4. In the **Property Definitions** dialog box, select a property for editing and click **Edit.**
5. Select the **Mapping** tab to add or remove a property mapping.

### Create a New Property Mapping

1. On the new (or existing) **Property** dialog, select the **Mapping** tab.
2. Click in the **(Click here to add a new mapping)** field beneath the **Entity** column.

   ![udp editor](../images/mapping-createnew.png)

   * Entity: Select what you want to map this property to/from - File or Item. You may have multiple mappings on a property so you can map to both files and items, but they must be mapped separately.
   * Provider: Displays a list of available options for the selected Entity type. These can be CAD files such as AutoCAD or Inventor drawings and models, Office Documents, PDF files, etc.
   * File Property: File property options depend on the Entity type. If the Entity type is File, you will be able to select a file property either from your file system or from the Vault. If the Entity type is Item, your will be only able to map to a file that exists in the Vault.

     + Click in the field under File Property and then click Import Properties.

       ![property mapping tab](../images/mapping-importproperties.png)
     + Select whether you want to import properties from the vault or from a source file.
     + On the Select File dialog, locate the file from which you want to import. Click Open.

       The **Import Properties** list is automatically updated with the properties available for import from the specified source.
     + Click **OK** to save the imported property list and create the mapping.
     + Click the **Clear Properties list** icon ![clear list icon](../images/property-clear-list.png) at any time to remove all imported properties.
   * Type: It is based on the property selected (depends on the type of data associated with the File Property, such as Text, Date, Number etc.)
   * Classification: Indicates whether the File Property is a Standard Property or a Custom Property.
   * Mapping: Informs the Vault how to push/pull the data being shared between the Vault Property and the File Property. It can be:

     + Vault to File
     + File to Vault
     + Bidirectional
   * Create: Determines whether the Vault will create the property on the file if it doesn't exist. If your mapping direction is File to Vault, this option is set to No, as properties in the Vault cannot be created in this manner.

     Note: If the Create option is set to "No", property compliance treats a null or empty property value as the property doesn't exist in the file. If the Create option is set to "Yes", it writes the correct value to the property.

     For AutoCAD block attributes, the Create option has only "No" value available.

   Note: Some of the fields are non-editable, so if you need to make major changes to a mapping, you may need to delete it and create a new one.
3. On the Mappings tab, click **OK** to commit all changes and return to the Edit Property dialog box.

### Edit Mapping Priorities

Properties at the top of the list take precedence over those lower on the list. You can reorganize the list using the Move Up and Move Down arrow icons on the Mapping tab.

1. Select the property on the Mapping tab that you want to prioritize, and click the **Move Up** or **Move Down** arrow icons as needed to change mapping priority.
2. Click **OK** to commit all changes and return to the Property Definitions dialog box.

Note: A subordinate property is a property that receives its values from other properties that are mapped to it. The mapped properties (the primary properties) write values to the subordinate property.

### Synchronize Mapped Properties for Inventor Drawings

Customize how to synchronize mapped properties for Inventor drawings from Vault Client to Inventor.

By default, the drawings are updated using the Inventor Server which means if you want to update the document, you need to open it in Inventor. You can also update Inventor drawings through tag

```
<add key="UpdateDrawingDocINV" value="1"/>
```

found in the XML config file within the vault installation directory (C:\Program Files\Autodesk\Vault Client <year>\Explorer\Connectivity.VaultPro.dll.config). However, when using this tag, you may observe that the synchronization performance slows.

If you want to update old version Inventor drawings you also need to set UpdateRevBlockMigrateLatestINV to "True".

#### Configure Data Cards for the Inventor Vault Add-in

# Configure Data Cards for the Inventor Vault Add-in

The [Data Cards](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-3F5949F1-41BB-4981-B122-3D88C56F5D6F) feature provides convenient summaries of the metadata assigned to a file or group of files through a single point of access.

Note: This feature is available in Autodesk Vault Professional.

The ability to view pertinent vault details and properties for specified files makes it easier to reference the information necessary for managing these files throughout the lifecycle of a model. With data cards, you can determine a file's vault status, see a thumbnail of the file, and review and modify property information without leaving the Inventor application.

Administrators can configure the data card layout on the Configure Data Card dialog in the Vault Settings dialog. Here they can determine how many pages a data card uses and which properties are displayed for modification. With the versatility to add and remove properties for editing, the administrator can streamline property management.

Select **Tools > Administration > Vault Settings > Behaviors** tab and then click the **Data Cards** button to access the Configure Data Card dialog.

## Configuring Data Card Layout

Manage tabs and determine which properties are available for the CAD user to modify on the Configure Data Card dialog. A properties list displays all of the properties that can be added to the selected tab. A property can be added to a single tab only once. Several different tabs, however, can list the same property.

Note: See the [Autodesk Vault Add-in](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-BBF6DA24-6B8C-4CEF-ACC5-619432AE5E10) topic for more information on using data cards with Inventor.

### Items Administration

# Items Administration

Learn about items administration in Vault.

Note: The Items feature is available only in Autodesk Vault Professional.

The **Items** tab contains options for configuring item behavior.

## Item Enablement

Enable or disable the Items feature to better control user access.

* Click **Configure** to display the **Enable Items and Change Orders** dialog box.

## Units of Measurement

Define and edit units of measurement for items.

* Click **Configure** to display the **Units of Measure** dialog box and to modify the default settings.

## Watermarking

Item watermarks can automatically be generated based on an item's lifecycle state, a specified item property, or customized text. In addition, administrators can configure the watermark style and position.

* Select a Watermark source from the **Watermarking** drop-down.

  + **Lifecycle-based**

    The Watermark value is based on the current lifecycle state of the item.

    Note: By default, an out-of-the-box lifecycle called Item Release Process is used.

    To select a new lifecycle, make sure Lifecycle-based is selected in the drop-down menu and click **Configure**.

```
-    **Property-based**

    The Watermark value is based on a specific item property you have identified on the Property-based Watermark Settings dialog.

    Note: You are automatically prompted to identify an item property the first time you select this option.

    To select a new item property for the watermark value, make sure Property-based is selected in the drop-down menu and click **Configure**.

-    **Custom**

    The Watermark value comes from a value you enter on the **Custom Watermark** Settings dialog.

    Note: You are automatically prompted to identify a text value for the watermark the first time you select this option.

    To select a new custom value for the watermark, make sure **Custom** is selected in the drop-down menu and click **Configure**.

-    **None**

    No Watermark is applied to items.
```

## Assign Item

Configure whether BOM rows are automatically turned on or not during item assignment.

* Click **Configure** to access the **Configure Assign Item** dialog.

## Property Write-Back

By default, item properties are written back to the associated file from Vault add-ins, Vault Client, and the Job Processor.

Item properties take precedence over file properties and file mappings. If the file's properties are edited and properties are synchronized, the item properties will overwrite the file properties.

Note: Item properties are written to tertiary links as well as long as the file is tertiary link to a single item.

* Clear the Write Item properties back to the file check box to disable item property write-back.

## Other

* **Allow user to assign category when creating a new item**–When selected, users are able to assign a category to an item when the item is created. This option is on by default.
* **Break file links from items based on Equivalence Value during item update**–When selected, Vault automatically breaks the link between an item and a file if the equivalence values do not match during an Update of the item.

  This setting is off by default.

#### Configure Item Assignment

# Configure Item Assignment

Configure how duplicate items are handled or whether BOM rows are automatically turned on or not during item assignment or item update on the Configure Assign Item dialog. You can also disable item assignment for design documents.

Configure Item Assignment Behaviors

1. Go to Tools > Administration > Vault Settings.
2. Select the Items tab.
3. Click Configure in the Assign Item section to open the Configure Assign Item dialog.
4. Select whether you want Vault to automatically select the first duplicate item in a list and assign it to the selected file. If you do not select this option, a new item is created instead.

   If this option is selected, child BOM Components will attempt to link to an existing item using the Equivalence Value property.

   Note: Standard components will always attempt to link to an existing item.
5. Select the Allow user override check box if you want the user to be able to choose a duplicate item other than the one automatically selected by Vault.
6. If you want to configure how BOM Rows are turned on during Item Assignment, select one of the following options:

   * **None–**Components that link to existing items are not turned on. All new item rows are turned off.

     Note: This is the default setting for new vaults.
   * **Existing Only–**Components that link to existing items are turned on. Components not linked to items remain as BOM components.
   * **All–**Components that do not link to existing items have new items created for them. All new rows are turned on.

     Note: This is the default setting for Vaults migrated from Vault 2014 or earlier releases.

   Note: These rules apply until a row is linked to an item. Once a row has an item identified, rows are not turned on or off during subsequent updates.
7. Select Group BOM rows as per the design BOM if you want BOM rows merged or unmerged based on how the CAD application has them.

   If the check box is not selected, BOM rows are automatically merged, regardless of how the CAD application has them.

   For example, if Inventor has BOM rows unmerged and the check box is not selected, the rows are automatically merged in Vault regardless of how Inventor has them.

   Note: BOM rows that were merged are displayed in the BOM view with a Merged ![](../images/icon-bom-merged.png) icon.
8. Select the type of link that you want Vault to create for subcomponents during an Assign/Update event.

   Note: The selection applies only to new subcomponent links. Existing links are not updated.

   See Work with Item Links for more information about link types.
9. Select Disable assignment for Design Document files if you want to disable the ability to assign item to design files such as .idw files. If this option is checked, design files will only be linked to the Items for which they represent.

   * When this option is not set, an IDW is set to tertiary when the primary is set to the model.
   * When this option is not set, and an IDW is a primary link, in this case, if this option is set afterward, you are no longer able to update the item. You need to set the model to the primary link first.
10. Select Block Assign Item if file has no Item Data to prevent items from being assigned to CAD files that can have item data but do not yet have any.

    This option is selected by default.
11. Click OK to save your changes.

#### Change Properties Used to Determine Duplicate Items

# Change Properties Used to Determine Duplicate Items

Map properties values that are used to determine duplicate items on the Properties dialog.

If a duplicate item is found, Vault automatically assigns the file to the duplicate item. If that item already has a primary link, the file may be added as a secondary link.

1. From the Tools menu select Administration and Vault Settings.
2. Select the Behaviors tab.
3. Click the Properties... button.
4. Highlight the Equivalence Value property and click Edit.
5. Add mappings to the properties whose values you wish to be used as equivalence comparisons.

For more information, see [Mapping Properties](GUID-915561C8-1143-4E68-BE41-37376FA39A58.htm)

The properties mapped to Equivalence Value, will provide the values used to determine if an existing item already exists for a file being newly assigned to item.

**Parent page:** [Items Administration](GUID-A88D9FBD-AF27-481A-AFEC-E5EACD6BB04E.htm)


#### Import Items

# Import Items

Use the Import Items Wizard to import items into a vault from external file sources.

Note: Items are available in Vault Professional.

You must be an Administrator or ERP Manager to import items.

Items can be imported from:

* Comma Separated Values (.csv)
* Tab Delimited Lines (.tdl or .txt)
* Autodesk Design Web Format (.dwf)
* Extensible Markup Language (.xml)

## Rules for Importing Items

* Items to be imported are checked to determine if there are conflicts with items that already exist. If any conflicts exist, they must be [resolved](GUID-252F38E3-3CAB-4F73-B3C3-F36AA381EB42.htm) before importing.
* Security on the imported item is respected by Vault. For example, if you do not have write permissions for the item, you cannot overwrite the item using the Import Workflow.
* If an item is imported from ERP and there is no value for the category, revision scheme, or lifecycle, the default category defined by Vault is applied to the item. The revision scheme and lifecycle assigned to the default category are also applied to the item.
* When items are imported from .dwf files, the associated files and their attachments are attached to the item. The files are treated like manually attached files.

  New files brought in during the import process are stored in a vault folder labeled Imported Item Documents. The files are organized within the Imported Item Documents folder by date and time. Once in the vault, the attached files can be moved to any location. If a file is already attached to the item in the item master, a new version of the file is added to the existing location in the vault.

Once a file is imported, a summary is displayed that can be printed or e-mailed.

## Creating Mapping Schemes for .CSV or .TDL Formats

When importing .csv or .tdl formats, you can define which Vault Professional attributes to import and then save this configuration as a mapping scheme. You can also apply the mapping scheme each time you import data.

If you do not map the following attributes, the default Vault Professional values are used:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| *Attribute* | *Default Value* |
| Item Category | General |
| Unit | Each |
| State | Work In Progress |
| Revision |  |

## Import a .csv file or a .tdl file

Note: For best results when importing a .csv file exported from an external application, export it from the other application using Unicode (UTF-8) encoding to ensure that all characters are imported into Vault Professional accurately.

1. In the Navigation pane, select Item Master.
2. From the Action menu, select Import Items.
3. In the Import Wizard, select CSV or TDL.
4. Specify how the BOM levels are indicated in the file to import:

     |  |  |  |
     | --- | --- | --- |
     | *Level* | *Item Number* | *Title* |
     | 1 | 000011 | Main Assembly |
     | 1.1 | 000012 | Part |
     | 1.2 | 000013 | Subassembly1 |
     | 1.2.1 | 000014 | Subassembly2 |
     | 1.2.1.1 | 000015 | Part1 |
   * Choose **Parent Item** if the file organizes items by parents:

     |  |  |  |
     | --- | --- | --- |
     | *Parent* | *Item Number* | *Title* |
     | <top> | 000011 | Main Assembly |
     | 000011 | 000012 | Part |
     | 000011 | 000013 | Subassembly1 |
     | 000013 | 000014 | Subassembly2 |
     | 000014 | 000015 | Part1 |
5. Enter a path and file name for the file to import or click **Browse** and locate the file.
6. Click **Next**.

#### Resolving ERP Import Conflicts

# Resolving ERP Import Conflicts

Some conflicts can occur when the imported file is compared to the specified mappings.

Some conflicts may include:

* The revision of a selected item is not in the current revision scheme
* The item revision in Vault Professional is later than the imported revision
* The unit of measure does not exist in Vault Professional
* The parent of an item can not be imported, preventing the item from being imported

Note: All conflicts must be resolved before importing a file. Turn on the Ignore all items with conflicts check box to import only items that do not have conflicts.

The Preview Results screen in the Import Wizard lists the items to be imported that conflict with existing items in Vault Professional. Items with conflicts are highlighted and items that cannot be imported are unavailable. Place the cursor in the Conflict column where a conflict is indicated to see a brief description of the conflict.

## Ignore Items

* Turn on the 'Ignore all items with conflicts' check box to skip any item that has a conflict and then click Next.

## Resolve Individual Conflicts

1. Double-click a row containing a conflict.
2. In the Conflict Resolution dialog:

   * To skip importing the item, click Ignore. Note you can ignore any item, not just items with conflicts, allowing you to choose which items to import.
   * If the item exists in Vault Professional, click Overwrite to replace the existing item.
   * If the item does not exist in Vault Professional, click Create to add it as a new item.
3. If you are creating a new item or overwriting an existing item and the Unit of Measure or Item Category doesn't exist in Vault Professional, you must map the value in the import file to an existing Vault Professional value. Select a replacement value from the drop-down list. Turn on the 'Apply to all subsequent occurrences of the value of the imported item' check box to apply the mapping to all occurrences of the value.
4. Click Detail to display the field values for the item and the corresponding Vault Professional item attributes. This can be used as an aid in resolving a conflict.
5. Click Done to resolve the conflict.

Note: If the imported item already exists in Vault Professional and is released, then the revision field value must be greater than the current value in the revision sequence. For example: for an alphabetic revision scheme, the value of the field in the import file must be D, E, F... if the Vault Professional revision is C.

#### Export Items

# Export Items

Export items in a vault to an external file.

Note: Items are available in Vault Professional.

You must be an Administrator or ERP Manager to export items.

Items can be exported to:

* comma-separated-values (.csv)
* Tab Delimited Lines (.tdl)
* Autodesk Design Web Format (.dwf)
* Extensible Markup Language (.xml)

## Rules for Exporting Items

* Item properties, bill of materials (BOM), and the Autodesk Inventor global BOM data are supported.
* When exporting a bom, the latest BOM is exported.
* When exporting to .csv or .tdl files, you can define which Vault Professional attributes to export and then save this configuration as a mapping scheme. You can then apply the mapping scheme each time you export data.
* Files are exported encoded in Unicode (UTF-8). When importing this data into another application, it may be necessary to specify the file is encoded in Unicode (UTF-8) so that all characters are accurately imported. For more information on importing Unicode (UTF-8) into another application, see the documentation for that specific application.
* Exporting items in the .dwf format exports the item's attached files, associated files, and the attached files to the associated files.

Tip: When exporting items, a master dwf package is created with sub-dwfs of the files. You can disable the creation of sub-dwfs by setting *export includeAttachments* to False in the web.config file.

## Export a .csv file or a .tdl file

### Users, Groups, and Roles

# Users, Groups, and Roles

Administrators can grant users access to a vault, create and assign roles, and create user groups.

The Global Settings Security tab contains options for granting user access to a vault and assigning user permissions. You can also create groups of users as well as assign access privileges and roles to the groups. The roles assigned to a user or group define the permissions of the user or members of the group.

**Access**

1. Select Tools > Administration > Global Settings.
2. In the Global Settings dialog, select the Security tab.

**Users and Groups**

User and Group accounts are created and administered in the User and Group Management dialog box. You can create a new user or group profile or edit an existing user or group profile.

1. Select Tools > Administration > Global Settings >Security tab.
2. Click Manage Access.

A vault server user account can be created automatically when a Windows user that is a member of an Active Directory group with access to the vault server logs into an Autodesk data management client using Windows authentication. This option is on by default.

Note: The server upon which the Autodesk Vault server is installed must support Windows Authentication.

Note: Windows Authentication is available in the Autodesk Vault Professional.

**Enforce Password Policy**

Enable the Enforce password policy check box for added security. This will help prevent unauthorized access and protect against potential security breaches.

Note: The ability to configure the Password Policy is governed by the same permissions as the Vault settings.

Click Configure to set the password policy settings. A password policy ensures that users create strong and complex passwords, as per the configured parameters. See [Configure Password Policy](GUID-D57A07AC-A396-4AF6-8B1B-25BA0A66D90A.htm).

**Roles and Permissions**

Roles are created and administered in the Role Management dialog. You can view the permissions assigned to a role when you create, copy, or edit a role.

1. Select Tools > Administration > Global Settings >Security tab.
2. Click Manage Roles.

#### Manage Access

# Manage Access

Create and manage user and group accounts.

User accounts and user groups define user roles, which define levels of access, or access privileges to functions in vault. Anyone who uses and interacts with vault must have a user account, and only an authenticated (i.e.-logged-in) administrator can add or edit user or group access to vault.

**Users**

Select the **Users** tab in the User and Group Management dialog box to create and manage user accounts.

A vault server user account can be created automatically when a Windows user that is a member of an Active Directory group with access to the vault server logs into an Autodesk Vault client using Windows authentication. This option is on by default.

Note: The server upon which the Autodesk Vault server is installed must support Windows Authentication.

* The Users tab lists the user profiles. Click New to create a new user profile or double-click the profile to edit the existing user profile.

Note: Windows Authentication is available in Autodesk Vault Professional.

**Groups**

Select the **Groups** tab in the User and Group Management dialog box to create and manage group profile. A group is a collection of users. Groups let you specify permissions for multiple users, which can make it easier to manage the permissions for those users.

* The Groups tab lists the group profiles. Click New to create a new group profile or double-click the profile to edit the existing group profile.

##### Manage Users

# Manage Users

User accounts are created and administered in the User and Group Management dialog box, and then assigned to vaults.

You can create a new user, view or edit a user profile. You can't delete a user, but you can disable an account so a user can no longer log in to the vault.

In addition to unique display names, users are assigned roles. Roles determine whether or not a user can administer the vaults, create folders, add and delete files, or get data. Each role is defined by a set of permissions. Role-based permissions are additive, so a user assigned multiple roles has all the privileges of the assigned roles. A user that does not have any role assigned and does not belong to a group with a role has no access to the vault. Administrators can create custom roles and assign specific permissions to those roles.

Note: To ensure a secure working environment, it is important to have unique user accounts.

##### Manage Groups

# Manage Groups

Groups are created and managed in the User and Group Management dialog box. Groups have roles and permissions assigned to them that define the actions they can take and the vaults they can access.

You can create groups of users and assign roles and permissions to the group. As a member of a group, a user has all the permissions and roles assigned to the group. By default, every new user is added to a group called Everyone. The Everyone group is only available on an Access Control Lists. It does not appear in the Group Profile dialog box. If the Everyone group is granted membership to a folder, all new users have access to that folder.

Groups can be comprised of users or other groups. Groups can be disabled, turning off all permissions assigned to the group. The permissions and roles assigned to a group are independent of individual user roles and permissions. Groups can also be restricted to specific folders within a vault, so you can keep projects and other data secure between groups.

By assigning users to groups and then granting folder membership to those groups, you can easily manage users and their access to vault folders. This is the best practice for creating a vault security model.

Note: Folder membership is only available with the vault server that is installed with Autodesk Vault.

A Group Manager can be assigned to a group to manage the group members. The Group Manager can manage only the groups they are given to, allowing for distributed administration of groups.

As a Group Manager, you can:

* View groups with profile attributes.
* Add or remove members from the group. All other fields are not editable. Refer to [Edit a group profile](GUID-5D92843C-3B99-4AAE-A32E-174C47CF6CAB.htm) for more information.

Note:

* A group manager must have User Read permissions to manage users of the group.
* Parent group's manager can't manage its subgroup.
* A group manager doesn't inherit group assigned roles/vaults.

Domain Groups can also have group managers who can add or remove group members. However, only administrator can update the domain group.

#### Manage Roles

# Manage Roles

Create, edit, copy, or delete roles.

The Autodesk Vault server is a secure database. A user must have an account to access data and must be assigned appropriate user permissions. Permissions are assigned based on roles. Roles determine whether or not a user can administer the vaults, create folders, add and delete files, or get data. When more than one role is assigned, the permission set is the union of the roles, extending the permissions of the user or group. Administrators can create custom roles and assign specific permissions to those roles.

### Custom Objects Definition Administration

# Custom Objects Definition Administration

Custom Objects allow Vault administrators to use an extensible system to create new Vault entities to meet the needs of their team, organization, or company.

Right out-of-the-box, the administrator can create a Custom Object definition and assign it categories, lifecycles, and properties. Once the Custom Object definition is created, users can create instances of that custom object directly through the user interface. As with files and folders, users can perform many common Vault tasks with custom objects.

## Custom Object Definitions vs. Custom Object Instances

There are two concepts to the Custom Objects entity class. They are Custom Object definitions and a Custom Object instances.

Custom Object Definition

* The Custom Object definition is the type of entity that is being created. For example, an administrator can create a custom object definition called Contacts or Tasks.

  Custom Object Definitions are created, edited, and deleted on the Configure Custom Objects Dialog. You can access the Configure Custom Objects Dialog through the Custom Objects Tab on the Vault Settings dialog. You must be an administrator to create and modify custom object definitions.

Custom Object Instance

* When the user creates a new custom object based on a definition, this is considered an instance. For example, an administrator creates a custom object definition called Contact. A user could then create an instance of that custom object called Bob Smith.
* Users can attach files, folders, and other Vault entities to a custom object with a link.

  For example, if a custom object definition has been created called Tasks and a user has created a task called review-john's-design, the task (review-john's-design) can be linked to John's design in the vault.
* Custom Object instances can be checked in, checked out, undergo a change state, and managed with many common Vault commands. Similarly, linked objects are also affected, depending on the user's settings for the Vault function.

  For example, if a user wants to check out a custom object and the custom object has links to files, folders, items, or change orders; the files associated with that linked data are gathered and checked out as well.

#### Create a New Custom Object Definition

# Create a New Custom Object Definition

Add a new entity class to your vault by creating a custom object definition.

1. In the Autodesk Vault Client, click Tools >Administration >Vault Settings.
2. In the Vault Settings dialog box, select the Custom Objects tab and click Configure.
3. On the Configure Custom Objects dialog, click New.
4. Enter a new Display name for a Custom Object. This name is used in the Vault User Interface when the new Custom Object is displayed.

   Note: A display name and plural display name are required because the Vault uses both contexts throughout the interface. Since there is no universal way to make a name plural, the administrator needs to insert the value upon creation.
5. By default new custom objects use object-based security. This can be customized by configuring different permissions for individual users and groups. For more information, see [File, Folder, Items, and Custom Object Security](GUID-07AB6615-AFDD-4C86-96DE-A3D334AF454B.htm).
6. New Custom Objects can use any icon file (\*.ico). Defining four different sizes of the icon will provide the best looking icons throughout the Vault interface (16x16 , 32x32, 64x64, or 128x128). If only one size is defined, it is stretched or compressed to fit each size. If no icon is available, the Use default Custom Object icon should be selected.

Note: New Custom objects do not appear in the user interface until the user logs out and logs back in after the Custom Object is created.

# Preview a Custom Object Definition

* Hover the cursor over preview field to preview how the icons appear in the Vault interface. If the images do not show up as clearly as desired, reconfigure the .ico file for a more appropriate image size.

#### Custom Objects–Categories, Lifecycles, and Properties

# Custom Objects–Categories, Lifecycles, and Properties

Custom objects can be assigned categories, lifecycle states, and properties.

**Categories**

Categories can be assigned to custom objects in two ways: when the custom object is created and when the user performs a change category event on the custom object. By assigning custom object instances to a category, properties and lifecycle definitions associated with the category are automatically applied to the instance.

See [Work with User-Defined Properties](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-5F0C9F22-0288-471E-8D64-D5F57FBE300A) for more information.

**Lifecycles**

Just like files and folders, when a custom object is assigned a category, it automatically inherits the associated lifecycle definition. Lifecycles can be configured to automate certain behaviors based on the custom object's status in the lifecycle. Lifecycle settings are configured by the administrator.

See [Lifecycles Administration](GUID-088F0236-B5B7-4E35-B218-BD2D253B87F6.htm) for more information.

**Properties**

Categories can also be used to assign user-defined properties to Custom Objects. There are also out-of-the-box properties specific to custom objects, such as Custom Object Name and Custom Object System Name.

See [Work with User-Defined Properties](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-5F0C9F22-0288-471E-8D64-D5F57FBE300A) for more information.

### Vault Factory Integration

# Vault Factory Integration

The Vault integration features let you store, view, and download assets; and manage libraries using Vault Professional.

To use this feature, the Vault administrator must first set up your asset library folders. See [Configuring Vault for Factory](http://help.autodesk.com/view/fds/2017/enu/?guid=guid-1e72d4e7-ca0f-4965-94f6-43298d650e4c) in the Factory Design Suite help for step by step configuration instructions.

### Configure Event Notifications

# Configure Event Notifications

Configure Autodesk Vault for lifecycle state transition and change order email notification.

Send automated emails to notify users when significant events are triggered. For example, if a document is moving from a "Work in Progress" state to a "Review" state, users may want to receive notifications when such changes occur, especially if they are involved in the approval or review process. This ensures that team members are promptly informed when new data is ready for their attention, eliminating the need for direct communication.

Note: This option is only available in Autodesk Vault Professional.

Follow these steps to configure email notification for users when an event occurs:

1. [Set up an email notification account](GUID-5A8B16C5-D82F-4C58-A37C-380E5C97B358.htm)

   Set up an email notification system to send automated emails whenever a state transition occurs.
2. [Configure email notification settings](GUID-372638C4-BD6F-4251-A6F3-FC50ED3F33B4.htm)

   Set up email notifications within Vault to alert selected members when a specified lifecycle state transition occurs, using a pre-defined email template.
3. [Customize email notification template](GUID-9976F3F9-A8F6-4025-A876-E6FB78B6F26C.htm)

   Create a custom email template for sending email notifications, including the subject line and body in a central location for all users.

### Data Standard Administration

# Data Standard Administration

Data Standard is a data control feature for the Vault Client, Inventor, and AutoCAD that allows administrators to enforce how users enter Vault data.

For some companies, users have too much freedom regarding Vault data. Users can deviate from company policy by selecting different folders in which to store design data, modifying properties for one file but not another, or ignoring naming schemes in one application but not another.

Data Standard allows administrators to customize dialogs that enforce a standardized workflow for entering Vault data across the Vault Client, AutoCAD, and Inventor applications. Since the Data Standard dialog is fully customizable, administrators can design the workflow that best suits their company's design needs.

## Details

The basic features of Data Standard are the same across all supported applications. Start your application, create a new document and start writing or designing your content. After the user first saves a file, the Data Standard dialog appears requesting certain data. Once the user has completed all of the fields, Data Standard generates the file name and location based on the data. The Save button becomes active only when all obligatory fields are complete.

Once the document has been saved, the entered data is mapped to the file's properties. The user does not have to worry about project folders, revising the file, or generating a file name. Data Standard does everything.

Note: See Using Data Standard for more information about the end user's process.

## Administration and Customization

Because every customer and every organization is different, Data Standard is highly configurable.

* User interface is 100% user-definable.
* User-defined properties have their own set of rules controlling when a property value is valid or not.
* Control the location (folder) where the file is stored when it is saved.
* Basic scenarios can be configured by editing the text-based xml and xaml files.
* Data Standard uses modern WPF technology for the user interface. This allows you to create very sophisticated solutions (e.g.,-leveraging-third-party-components).
* Windows PowerShell is used by default to implement the Data Standard logic.
* If your logic is more complex, you can add your own dll written in any .net capable programming language.

Note: Users must add signatures to their custom scripts and share the certificates accordingly if they enforce a signed script policy.

#### Vault Data Standard - Tutorial

# Vault Data Standard - Tutorial

The course targets Vault key users and Vault Administrators getting started with Data Standard customization. VDS offers several options to customize the behavior by enabling options in Vault Behavior Configuration, e.g., Vault Numbering for Projects. Other customizations require editing of VDS configuration files, like Dialog definitions or PowerShell scripts reflecting the business rules and user guidance handling file's metadata.

Advanced customizations, like dialog extensions by additional user controls or tabs, require more skills in creating Dialogs (Windows Presentation Foundation) and in writing PowerShell scripts using direct Vault API (Application Programming Interface) calls. This tutorial does not cover any advanced topics. However, the transition from Chapters 10 onwards to more in-depth scripting relates to each student's ambitions and interest in learning programming concepts.

## Content Overview

* Chapter 01 - Chapter 06: Essential Customizations that don't require scripting or programming skills
* Chapter 07 - Chapter 09: Customizations introducing editing of Data Sheet definition files (xaml)
* Chapter 10 - Chapter 13: Extended customizations using PowerShell scripting to build company-specific business rules and automation
* Chapter 14 - Use Vault themes and styles for custom configurations

##### Chapter 07 - Extend Datasheets - Static Properties

# Chapter 07 - Extend Datasheets - Static Properties

## Introduction

In Chapter 02, we already introduced the two areas of properties in Datasheets: The General Property area and the Dynamic Category Properties Grid.

![](../images/chapter7-propertygrid-1.png)

The grid of General Properties has static definitions, a label, and a content control bound to a Vault property, saved in the dialog definition file. The Dynamic Grid is an empty grid object that automatically adds labels and value fields through the selection of an entity (File, Folder, Custom Object) category. These two grids are the core elements in Create/Edit Datasheets (see the image before) and Datasheets in detail tabs:

![](../images/chapter7-propertygrid-2.png)

##### Chapter 08 - Multi-Language Support and Labeling

# Chapter 08 - Multi-Language Support and Labeling

## Introduction

Vault products ship offering 14 localization languages. The version 2020 introduced the concept of having an English default installation on each client and adding client language packs as required; a user flexible selects international English or a localized user interface.

![](../images/chapter8-languages.png)![](../images/Chapter8_localizedlanguages.png)

Vault Data Standard fully supports this concept by adopting the client's language. Any customization has access to the resources required to display labels, properties, tooltips, or any other text.

##### Chapter 10 - Auto-Select Categories

# Chapter 10 - Auto-Select Categories

## Introduction

The Data Standard default configuration assumes that Vault Professional users primarily create files of category Engineering, while Vault Office users usually start new files assigned to the Office category. Most customers implement more than a single category for Engineering or Office files, e.g., a differentiation for Part, Sheet Metal Part, Assembly, Drawings, and more. Usually, the assignment follows company-specific rules, and VDS is excellent in transforming these rules in Automation. A user no longer needs to apply these standards manually.

This chapter’s rule scripts change the default pre-selection of Category Engineering to the individual Categories Part, Assembly, or respective Drawing Categories in all VDS applications, AutoCAD, Inventor, and Vault.

![](../images/chapter10-newfileassembly.png)

Note: The link between category and numbering scheme selection breaks in this chapter; Chapter 11 teaches options to implement another rule to filter and pre-select matching numbering schemes.

## Learning Objectives

* Get introduced in reading VDS PowerShell scripts
* Learn how to set the default category in AutoCAD (Drawing AutoCAD)
* Learn how to set default categories in Inventor (part, assembly, sheet metal, IDW/DWG)
* Learn one way to set default categories in Vault Explorer

## Exercises

* Exercise 1 – Investigate the default script for CAD
* Exercise 2 – AutoCAD, Auto Select Category
* Exercise 3 – Inventor, Auto Select from Multiple Categories
* Exercise 4 – Vault, Re-Use Template Category

##### Chapter 11 - Filter Numbering Schemes

# Chapter 11 - Filter Numbering Schemes

## Introduction

Data Standard allows numbering for any Vault object type. In Chapter 03, we introduced a numbering scheme for projects that should be consumed by this category only. The same for the custom object of type Task introduced in Chapter 06. If numbering schemes are directly bound to a category, the user might not get confused in selecting the appropriate scheme. In Chapter 10, we eventually broke the principle “numbering scheme name = category” because we introduced various categories for Engineering files. This chapter talks you through the required scripting skills to limit the selection according to any context.

After completing all exercises, the numbering of new files, new projects or tasks follows the rules filtering numbering schemes to the required context as shown in the images for Projects, Tasks, and Files in Vault Explorer.

![](../images/chapter11-numberingschemeall.png)

For CAD applications, all files independently of the category selection filter to the numbering scheme "Engineering".

![](../images/chapter11-nuberingschemenewfile.png)

## Learning Objectives

* Understand how VDS handles numbering schemes
* Learn how to allow users to enable or disable Vault numbering flexibly
* Learn how to filter numbering schemes for CAD applications and Vault Explorer
* Learn how to pre-select a numbering scheme

##### Chapter 13 - Cascading Selections

# Chapter 13 - Cascading Selections

## Introduction

Vault Data Standard targets to consistently fill metadata based on company rules and individual glossaries. In these regards, classification indexes or abbreviations are a common requirement for extended VDS configurations. Cascading pull-down menus are popular user controls to navigate through hierarchically structured catalogs of terms, classifications, or standards. This chapter introduces how to include external data sources for selections, how to build interdependencies of user controls in VDS Dialogs (Data Sheets), and how to bind selection results with Vault User Defined Properties.

## Learning Objectives

* Accessing an external data source in Vault Data Standard user dialogs
* Mapping of hierarchically structured data to hierarchically related user controls (Combo Box control)
* Binding of user-defined property values to the results of cascading selections
* Implementing usability enhancements

##### Data Standard Configuration Files for AutoCAD and Inventor

# Data Standard Configuration Files for AutoCAD and Inventor

The Data Standard Add-in for AutoCAD and Inventor provides two unique configuration files that determine Data Standard sheet behavior. Modify these behaviors to suit your design workflow.

You can dynamically set property configuration while a dialog is loaded (use the InitializeWindow function).

Note: This topic applies only to the Data Standard add-in for Inventor and AutoCAD.

The following behaviors are defined in the Data Standard configuration files.

* Which fields and properties are available in Data Standard.
* Where the file is saved.
* The file name.
* **Inventor only–**If Data Standard dialog is displayed automatically when saving.
* **Inventor only–**If the Vault Check-in dialog is displayed.
* **AutoCAD only–**Which AutoCAD Mechanical title blocks are supported.

## Configuration File Details

There are two unique configuration files for the Data Standard Add-in for AutoCAD and Inventor.

* Inventor.cfg
* AutoCAD.cfg

You can find both of these files in C:\ProgramData\Autodesk\<Vault edition>\Extensions\DataStandard\CAD.

The CFG file is loaded only once when starting the CAD application.

## File Elements

The configuration files are in XML format. Use a text editor or an XML editor to modify element values in the file.

Note: Most of the elements in the files are the same for Inventor and AutoCAD. However, some elements are only valid for either Inventor or AutoCAD. There are also small differences between some elements, depending on the file.

### PathDefinition

Defines where the file is saved. The definition can be a mix of plain text or variables. The expression entered is evaluated every time the user enters or changes data. The closing back-slash is not required. The supported variables are:

* `{Workspace}`

  This will contain the path to your workspace as defined in the project file.
* `{Prop[<property name>].Value}`

  This is the value of the file property and changes as soon as the user enters data into a Data Standard dialog field mapped to the property <property name>.

  Sample:

  ```
  <PathDefinition>{Workspace}\{Prop[PROJECT].Value}</PathDefinition>
  ```

  In this sample, the path generated by Data Standard is the workspace folder set in the application plus the project name selected or entered into the Data Standard dialog. As the workspace will not change, this part is fixed, while the project path changes depending on the user data.

### FileNameDefinition

Defines how the file is named. The definition can be a mix of plain text or variables. The expression is evaluated every time the user enters or changes data. The file extension is omitted but is automatically attached by Data Standard. The supported variables are:

* `{Prop[<property name>].Value}`

  This is the value of the file property. The value changes as soon as the user enters data in a Data Standard dialog field mapped to the property *<property name>*.

  Samples:

  ```
  <FileNameDefinition>{Prop[TITLE].Value}</FileNameDefinition>
  ```

  The file name is generated out of the value of the Title property.

  ```
  <FileNameDefinition>{Prop[YEAR].Value}_{Prop[NUMBER].Value}</FileNameDefinition>
  ```

  The file name is generated out of the combination of the Year and Number properties with an underscore in between.

### PropertyDefinitions

Contains one or more `<PropertyDefinition>` elements. The `<PropertyDefinition>` is the core of this configuration file and lets you define one or more properties.

**Important:** The PropertyDefinition is only required, if the (default) DynamicPropertyGrid control in the dialog is not used, or to apply overrides to the constraints, for example to set a property Required=True. Even Vault configuration (DynamicGrid) does not require a value for this property.

All the fields that will be accessible in the Data Standard dialog as a property must be defined here. The name of the property is also the name of the file or title-block attribute. If the property name matches an existing file property, such as "Title", it is used directly. Otherwise a custom property is created.

Sample:

```
...
<PropertyDefinitions>
    <PropertyDefinition PropertyName="DocNumber" DataType="Text" InitialValue="{PathAndFileNameHandler.FileName}" InitialCopyValue="{UIString[CFG2]} {PathAndFileNameHandler.OriginalFileName}" />
    <PropertyDefinition PropertyName="Title" DataType="Text" InitialCopyValue="{UIString[CFG1]} {Prop[Title].Value}" RequiresValue="true" />
    <PropertyDefinition PropertyName="Description" DataType="Text" />
    <PropertyDefinition PropertyName="Comments" DataType="Text" />   
    <PropertyDefinition PropertyName="Folder" DataType="Text" InitialValue="." RequiresValue="true"/>
    <PropertyDefinition PropertyName="Original" DataType="Text" InitialCopyValue="{PathAndFileNameHandler.OriginalFullFileName}" />
</PropertyDefinitions>
...
```

The available attributes for `<PropertyDefinition>` are:

| Attribute | Required | Valid Values | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PropertyName | Yes | Characters and numbers | The name of the property. |
| DataType | Yes | Text, Date, Boolean, Integer, Double | Defines the data type and is required to create custom properties. |
| InitialValue | No | Depending on DataType:  *Text*– A combination of text and variables (see below).  *Date*– Valid date or "now" for the current date.  *Boolean*–– "true" or "false"  *Integer, Double*– Valid numbers. | Defines the initial value when saving a document for the first time. |
| InitialCopyValue  Note: Inventor Only | No | Depending on DataType:  *Text*– A combination of text and variables (see-below).  *Date*– Valid date or "now" for the current date.  *Boolean*–– "true" or "false"  *Integer, Double*– Valid numbers. | Defines the initial value when copying a document. This attribute is for Inventor only. |
| RequiresValue | No | true, false, or the name of a PowerShell function | Used for validation. With a PowerShell function more complex validation rules can be implemented. |

The attributes `InitialValue` and `InitialCopyValue` allow the combination of plain text and variables for text properties. The supported variables are:

* `{PathAndFileNameHandler.<field>}`

  Can be used to retrieve information about the internal filenames and locations of the document. Available fields are:

  + `FileName`: The filename of the document without the filepath.
  + `FullFileName`: The full path of the document.
  + `OriginalFileName`: **Inventor only.** Is available when copying documents and returns the filename of the original document without the filepath.

    For example: `{UIString[CFG2]} {PathAndFileNameHandler.OriginalFileName}` returns "Copy\_of\_Part1.ipt."
* `{Prop[<property name>].Value}`

  **Inventor only.** Returns the value of the file property <property name>.
* `{UIString[<ID>]}`

  **Inventor only.** Returns the value of the localized text string from UIStrings.xml specified by <ID>. See [Localization](GUID-244DFF1D-7473-41D8-AA7D-43A3FB25D17F.htm) for more details.

### ShowCheckinDialog

Set to True or False to indicate whether the Vault check-in dialog is displayed when clicking OK on the Data Standard dialog for a document that is being saved for the first time.

### SkipForProperties

**Inventor only.** This element is a comma-separated list of property names. The automatic Data Standard dialog is not shown for documents that have a file property which is in this list. One usage scenario is to skip the Data Standard dialog for third-party content center parts (e.g., Content center-generated parts).

Sample:

```
<SkipForProperties>CDN_B</SkipForProperties>
```

### SupportedFileTypes

**Inventor only.** Defines which document types are supported. For example if you do not want the Data Standard dialog to display for Inventor DWG files, the element looks like this:

```
<SupportedFileTypes>IDW,IAM,IPT,IPN</SupportedFileTypes>
```

### TitleBlock

**AutoCAD only.** This element is a comma-separated list of AutoCAD block names that are synchronized with Data Standard. Three settings are required and one additional is recommended to support legacy files.

Sample:

```
<TitleBlock>ISO_TITLEA,ISO_TITLEB,DIN_TITLE</TitleBlock>
```

## Property Mapping for AutoCAD

Data Standard uses AutoCAD file properties, so the primary mapping of UDPs has to be configured to file properties.

Data Standard allows to synchronize the property values to block attributes. To achieve this, 3 settings are required and 1 additional recommended to support legacy files, not having file properties, but only block attributes

##### Data Standard Custom Objects Administration

# Data Standard Custom Objects Administration

Configure creation dialogs and tabs to display custom object data.

**Requirements**

Three components are required for custom object support:

* Menu entries for the create and edit dialog.
* Dialog files (.xaml) for the dialogs and tabs.
* Scripting files (PowerShell) for the dialog logic.

## Use Pre-Configured Custom Object "Task"

By default, all three components are provided with Data Standard. These components are pre-configured to work with a custom object in Vault called Task.

Note: Context menu support for custom objects is only available if a custom object exists.

1. Through the Vault configuration, create a custom object definition and call it Task.

   Note: See [Custom Objects Administration](GUID-E1BA9E4A-443F-43EA-B8BF-3CAA382C25A3.htm) for more information.
2. Assign the Title and Description properties to the Base category.
3. Restart Vault Explorer and log into Vault two times:

   * The first time you log in, check that the Tasks object type is available in the Vault Client.
   * Log out and log in a second time to initialize the Datasheet tab and the menu items to create and edit Tasks.

   The new custom object Task is fully initialized and ready to use.
4. Create a new custom object using the New command and name it anything you want.
5. Right-click on the new custom object. The context menu now shows New Task and Edit Task as menu options.

Note: When logging-in the first time after a new custom object has been defined, the file CustomEntityDefinitions.json (%programdata%\Autodesk\<Vault edition>\Extensions\DataStandard\Vault) is created. The definition in the file is used to initialize the tab and the menu items for the custom objects. The file should not be modified manually. To avoid users having to login several times, the file can be deployed. If you cannot initialize custom objects, the file can be deleted. It is created the next time you log into a vault.

## Configure Additional Custom Objects

To define your own custom object, copy the three components from the Task sample and modify as needed.

Following are examples of a custom object called Person.

### Menu Entries

The context menu entries to create and edit a dialog are defined here:

%programdata%\Autodesk\<Vault version>\Extensions\DataStandard\Vault\MenuDefinitions.xml

The menu entry definitions must be created:

1. Copy the definitions (*MenuItem NewTask*, *MenuItem EditTask*) from the Task sample.
2. Replace Task with Person in all variables.
3. Modify Description, Hint, Label and Navigation Types.

   Note: For these variables, the UIString syntax in the original sample can be used. See [Localization](GUID-244DFF1D-7473-41D8-AA7D-43A3FB25D17F.htm) for more information.

   ```
   <NewTask Label="CreatePerson..." 
   Description="New Person"
   Hint="Create a new person object" 
   PSFile="CreateCustomObject.ps1"
   Image="NewCustomObject.ico"
   ToolbarPaintStyle="TextAndGlyph"
   NavigationTypes="Person"
   MultiSelectEnabled="false"/>

   <EditTaskLabel="Edit Person..." 
   Description="Edit Person"
   Hint="Edit a person object"
   PSFile="EditCustomObject.ps1"
   Image="EditCustomObject.ico"
   ToolbarPaintStyle="TextandGlyph"
   NavigationTypes="Task"
   MultiSelectEnabled="False"/>
   ```

   Next, create a menu site for the new custom object.

   1. Copy the site (*CommandSite Task*) from the Task sample.
   2. Replace Task with Person in all variables.

      ```
       <TaskLabel="Person"
        DeployAsPullDown="False"
        Location="Person">
        <ItemName="NewPerson">
         </Item>
        <ItemName="EditPerson">
         </Item>
      ```

See [Customize the Data Standard MenuDefiniftions.xml File](GUID-02BAAA7C-330F-4B21-8D9D-8D4BB27AC428.htm) for more details about the menu syntax.

### Scripting Files

The menu definitions in the MenuDefinitions.xml file point to powershell files. These files are located at %programdata%\Autodesk\<Vault version>\Extensions\DataStandard\Vault\addinVault\Menus.

The default CreateCustomObject.ps1 and EditCustomObject.ps1 powershell file work for every custom object. There is no need to create additional powershell files. However, it is still possible to customize and create powershell files for the new custom object by performing these tasks:

1. Copy the *CreateCustomObject.ps1* and *EditCustomObject.ps1* menu definition files and rename them as *CreatePerson.ps1* and *EditPerson.ps1*.
2. Similar to other scripts, the create and edit custom object scripts point to a related XAML file.

   Modify the XAML filename that defines the Data Standard dialog by replacing Task with Person.

   ```
   ...
   $xamlFile = New-Object CreateObject.WPF.XamlFile "PersonXaml", "%ProgramData%\Autodesk\Vault 2016\Extensions\DataStandard\Vault\Configuration\Person.xaml"
   $dialog.XamlFile = $xamlFile
   ...
   ```

### Dialogs and Tab

The XAML file for the custom object create and edit dialog is specified in the PowerShell files (see above). By default, the XAML files for the create and edit dialogs as well as the tabs are located here:

%programdata%\Autodesk\<Vault version>\Extensions\DataStandard\Vault\Configuration

The default CustomObject.xaml works without any changes. However, you must use the CustomObject.xaml file as a template to create a XAML file for the new custom object.

1. Copy CustomObject.xaml file and name it Person.xaml.
2. Modify the new XAML file with these steps:

   * Replace all occurrences of `TaskWindow` with `PersonWindow`.
   * Correct the dialog title by adding *New Person* and *Edit Person Datasheet* to the UiStrings.xml and replacing the IDs with the IDs for the new text strings `UIString[LBL61]` and `UIString[LBL62]`.
   * Add or remove property controls as needed.
3. Change the following functions in %programdata%\Autodesk\<Vault version>\Extensions\DataStandard\Vault\addinVault\Default.ps1 by configuring:

   * `InitializeWindow` to control the size of the dialog.
   * `GetCategories` to support dynamic properties based on categories.
   * `Validate` to implement validation rules.

### Get a Datasheet tab for the new custom object

1. Copy the Task folder and name it Person.
2. If needed, update the Datasheet.xaml in the Person folder (e.g., add or remove properties).

**Parent page:** [Data Standard Configuration](GUID-547E1852-A866-45ED-A687-294208B412AB.htm)


##### Data Standard and Localization

# Data Standard and Localization

The dialogs and tabs that come with Data Standard automatically support twelve different languages.

Text strings for these languages are defined in XML files. The files are located here:

C:\ProgramData\Autodesk\<Vault version>\Extensions\DataStandard\<localization folder>

where *<language code>* is the folder name for a language (e.g., en-US, de-DE, it-IT).

Each language folder contains two files:

* UIStrings.xml–Contains strings that are visible in dialogs, tabs, and menus.
* PropertyTranslations.xml–Contains mapping for Vault properties, from a language independent property name to the real property name in the Vault database.

These files can be extended to support different languages in customized Data Standard dialogs.

## How Is the Language Determined?

### Vault Client

By default, the language used for the Data Standard UI strings and the property translations is the same as the Vault client that is installed. However, this can be overridden by modifying the DSLanguages.xml file located at:

C:\ProgramData\Autodesk\<Vault version>\Extensions\DataStandard\Vault.

Set the DSLanguages.xml correctly: Change the DB Language manually to the language of the server, for example en-US. Leave the Language Code ID=UI blank: It enables Vault Client to read property labels, messages and headers from the source based on the active language pack (for example, to read values from de-DE\UIString.xml).

```
<Language_Code ID="DB">en-US</Language_Code>
    <Language_Code ID="UI"></Language_Code>
```

Change Category values – UIStrings.xml: Category names in the Category Combobox VDS dialogs aren't displayed when the language of Client is different from the language of the server. Therefore, we recommend changing the Category names in the UIStrings.xml to the Category names that correspond with the language of vault server. See picture below:

![](../images/data-standard-localization-examples.png)

### CAD

For Inventor and AutoCAD, the language is determined automatically and cannot be set. Data Standard tries to use the same language that the CAD application uses. If the CAD application uses a language that is not supported by Data Standard, English is used as fallback.

The Vault database language is not relevant for the CAD applications because Data Standard uses mapped properties (Inventor iProperties, AutoCAD DWG properties, and block attributes).

## UI Strings

Sample: UIStrings.xml

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

<UIStrings LanguageCode="en-US">
        <UIString ID="LBL1">Folder</UIString>
    <UIString ID="LBL2">Title</UIString>
    <UIString ID="LBL3">Description</UIString>
...
</UIStrings>
```

The XML file contains a `<UIStrings>` element with an attribute `LanguageCode` to specify the language. The `<UIStrings>` element is a collection of `<UIString>` elements. The attribute ID has to be unique. For your own strings, Autodesk recommends that you use a prefix (e.g., **ID="MYPREFIX\_LBL1"**). The value of the element is the text string.

### How to Use UI Strings

The UI strings can be used in different Data Standard components by using the following expressions:

* XAML Files: `UIString[<ID>]`

  For example, `<Label Content="{Binding UISTring[LBL2]}"/>`

  The above sample looks in the UIStrings.xml (based on the used language) for a `<UIString>` element with the ID LBL2 and returns the Title string and displays this as a label in the dialog.
* PowerShell files: `$UIString["<ID>"]`
* MenuDefinitions.xml File: `$UIString[<ID>]`. The MNU file was replaced the with the MenuDefinitions.xml file in VDS 2017.

  This can be used in variables `Description`, `Hint`, `Label`, and `NavigationTypes` of a menu item definition. See [MenuDefinitions.xml-File](GUID-02BAAA7C-330F-4B21-8D9D-8D4BB27AC428.htm) for more information.
* Labeling in Dynamic Category Properties Grid. By default, the first column in Dynamic Category Grid lists the property name (System Name).

  + Note that for Vault Client Data Standard the label is pulled from the `$UIString[<ID>]` which has a mapping to the ‘system-name’. To review the system name of a user-defined property, add the “system-name” column “System to the grid in: Vault Administration > Behaviors > Properties > Create/Edit Property.
  + For Data Standard for inventor and AutoCAD the label is pulled from the `$UIString[<ID>]` which has a mapping to a custom 'iProperty (Inventor) or a custom File Property' (AutoCAD) or a block attribute name (AutoCAD). A localized designation enables a dynamic override of the label.

### UIString Example:

```
  <UIString ID ="7b6a617f-bf95-426f-a2fl-b4d0e9eec0a3">Zeichnungs-Titel</UIString>
```

Result in the Dynamic Category Grid for en-US, for client started in de-DE:

![](../images/data-standard-localization.png)

## Property Translations

Sample: PropertyTranslations.xml

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<PropertyTranslations LanguageCode="en-US">
  <PropertyTranslation Name="NAME">Name</PropertyTranslation>
  <PropertyTranslation Name="TITLE">Title</PropertyTranslation>
  <PropertyTranslation Name="DESCRIPTION">Description</PropertyTranslation>
...
</PropertyTranslations>
```

The XML file contains a `<PropertyTranslations>` element with an attribute `LanguageCode` to specify the language. The `<PropertyTranslations>` element is a collection of `<PropertyTranslation>` elements. The attribute `Name` has to be unique. The value of the element is the display name of the Vault property.

### How to Use Property Translations

In XAML and in PowerShell files, Vault properties can be accessed by `Prop[<property name>]` expressions. Instead of using a fixed property name, the following syntax can be used:

* XAML Files: `<TextBox Text="{Binding Prop[_XLTN_<Name>].Value}"`

  For example: `<TextBox Text="{Binding Prop[_XLTN_DESCRIPTION].Value}"/>`

  The `prefix_XLTN_` in the above sample looks in the PropertyTranslations.xml for a `<PropertyTranslation>` element with the name DESCRIPTION and replaces the complete expression `_XLTN_DESCRIPTION` with the value Description. The content of the text box is then bound to the Vault property Description.
* PowerShell file: `$Prop["_XLTN_<Name>"].Value`

Note: For CAD, this property translation is not used because the iProperties, DWG properties, and title block attributes are not language dependent.

##### Data Standard Templates

# Data Standard Templates

Data Standard uses document templates to create new Data Standard files.

By default, the New Standard File function looks in the $\Templates folder in Vault for document templates. This path can be modified in the Data Standard File.xml.

Administrators also have the option of specifying separate template folders for different applications (e.g., one for AutoCAD templates and another for Inventor templates).

## How It Works

The default New File dialog for Data Standard contains a combo box called Document Type.

![](../images/templates.png)

When a user selects an option from the Document type list and clicks OK, the New Data Standard File function looks for a template in the Vault folder path associated with that document type. The template is used to generate the new file.

%programdata%\Autodesk\<Vault version>\Extensions\DataStandard\Vault\Configuration\File.xml

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
                <DocTypeData xmlns="">
                    <DocTypeInfo>
                        <DocName>Inventor</DocName>
                        <Path>$/Templates/Inventor</Path>
                    </DocTypeInfo>
                    <DocTypeInfo>
                        <DocName>AutoCAD Drawings</DocName>
                        <Path>$/Templates/AutoCAD</Path>
                    </DocTypeInfo>
                    <DocTypeInfo>
                        <DocName>Office Document</DocName>
                        <Path>$/Templates/Office</Path>
                    </DocTypeInfo>
                </DocTypeData>
```

The element `<Name>` defines the value that is displayed in the combo box on the New File dialog. The element `<TemplatePath>` is invisible to the user, but is used to set the "templatepath" inside the View Model.

The Document Type combo box looks like this:

```
...
<Label Content="Document Type" Grid.Row="2" Grid.Column="0" />
<ComboBox ItemsSource="{Binding Source={StaticResource DocTypes}, XPath=DocTypeInfo}"
          Name="DocTypeCombo"
          Grid.Row="2"
          Grid.Column="1"
          IsEnabled="{Binding IsNewEntryDialog}"
          DisplayMemberPath="Name"
          SelectedValuePath="templatepath"
          SelectedValue="{Binding TemplatePath}"
          SelectedIndex="0"></ComboBox>
...
```

The attribute `DisplayMemberPath` defines which element from the data source is used for display in the combo box. In this instance, it is set to Name.

The attribute `SelectedValuePath` defines which element from the data source ("TemplatePath") is set as the template path value to use.

The attribute `SelectedValue="{Binding TemplatePath}"` sets the selected template path in the View Model. The new binding property "templatepath" has to be added to the View Model.

## Vault Office Data Standard Templates

The Vault Office client provides many of the same Vault client features but is slimmed down to focus on non-CAD design data management processes. Since the Vault client and the Vault Office client each have their own XAML, it is possible to create unique Data Standard dialogs for each client.

Customize Data Standard dialogs for the Vault Office Client by modifying the FileOffice.xml.

A template is already defined for the Vault Office client called FileOffice.xml.

The FileOffice.xml is located at %programdata%\Autodesk\<Vault version>\Extensions\DataStandard\Vault\Configuration

##### Data Standard XAML Files

# Data Standard XAML Files

Every dialog in Data Standard is based on a file with the extension .XAML (Extensible Application Markup Language). Customize the Data Standard dialog by modifying the XAML file.

## Overview

XAML files describe the layout of the Data Standard dialog, including which controls (label, text-box, combo-box, etc.) are used, and to which CAD or Vault properties the controls are bound.

XAML files are XML files, and can be edited with any text/XML editor. A good choice for a free XML editor is the [Microsoft XML Notepad](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=7973guid-d890dcfe-0f1f-4735-a3f9-bc35bef7368c) or any other editor that can format XML. Autodesk recommends Visual Studio (Express or higher) for the best editing experience. Since the XAML syntax is case sensitive, it is best to use an editor that will support capitalization and catch typos.

Edit the XAML file if a Data Standard dialog needs to show more, less, or different information. The PS1 files located in the Configuration folder control dialog behavior.

This topic provides a brief description of the most used controls. More information on these controls as well as other controls can be found on the Microsoft help pages.

## Anatomy of a XAML File

Each XAML file has different sections: the Resource, Style, and controls sections are most used.

In the Resource section, there are definitions that are reused in the controls sections. For instance, if your company color is green, you can define that all text displayed on the controls is green.

Triggers are located in the Style section. Triggers define how a control looks or behaves, depending on the given situation (e.g., creating a new record or editing an existing one). However, more complex behaviors are defined in the PS1 files.

The controls section, or layout area, usually starts with the control `<Grid>`. The grid splits the dialog into rows and columns, like an Excel table. Combine and split cells as required by your design. In each cell, you can place one or more controls, such as labels, for simple text or text-boxes for text input.

## Layout

The layout of a XAML file is similar to a table, with rows and columns. This makes the dialog and its controls dynamic, which means that if you resize the window with the mouse, the controls automatically resize too. You can also work with fixed coordinates, but in this case, when the dialog is resized by the user, or some users have a larger windows font configured, the controls in the dialog remain at their coordinates and potentially overlap or do not consume the available space in the dialog. For this reason, Autodesk recommends using the table approach and letting every control expand inside the defined cell.

Since your dialog is like a table, when you design the dialog, think of how many columns and rows you need. Usually two columns are fine: one left with a fixed width for the labels and one right with a dynamic width for the controls. This is also how the default dialogs are made. Depending on how many rows you need, according row definitions are defined in the grid. Every control inside the Grid has a reference to the row and column (always starting with 0), so that the control is shown accordingly.

## Syntax

In XML and XAML, every keyword is embedded in age brackets (<keyword>). Usually a definition block starts with a keyword, such as <Grid>, and ends with the same keyword prefixed with a slash, like </Grid>. In the case of a single line statement, you may also see this syntax: <Label ... />. Further attributes of the keyword, or further keywords nested inside, define the structure of the dialog. XAML is case-sensitive, so pay attention on the upper/lower cases.

## Most Used Controls

### Grid

The Grid is a layout panel that controls everything in a tabular structure of rows and columns. All cells (a cell is unique by its combination of a row and a column) can contain multiple controls, like labels and text boxes.

![](../images/grid-controls.png)

This is the basic structure of a grid. The grid requires rows, which you define in the Grid.RowDefinition part. Height 30 defines a fixed value for the height and cannot be changed afterwards. The value "auto" gives the row a dynamic height, so it can be thicker or thinner, depending on the controls. The same values apply to the Column width.

After defining your rows and columns, you can add controls, such as labels and text boxes. Controls must be attached at the two properties: Grid.Column and Grid.Row. These properties define the location of the control in the grid. The first row is 0, so the second row is 1, etc.

### Label

Labels are field names that the user cannot edit. They contain text indicating what the label is for, so the user knows which type of value has to be inserted in the corresponding text box or combobox. For example, a label called Comments might be located beside an empty text box. The user would know to provide any comments in that text box.

The Label has a Content property. This property is the text that is displayed for the label.

`<Label Content="sample" Grid.Row ="0" Grid.Colum="0"/>`

In the default dialogs are code strings like this `<Label Content="{Binding UIString\[LBL2\]}" ....>`, where the Content is bound to a localized text. This syntax is used when the dialog shows text in different languages. If your project needs only one language, then set the text that you want to show. If the dialog needs to be localized, use the localization syntax. See [Localization](GUID-244DFF1D-7473-41D8-AA7D-43A3FB25D17F.htm) for more information.

### TextBox

Text boxes are fields that the user can edit. Data Standard can read the entered value and use it for other operations.

The text box needs the following properties:

* *Text*–The initial text that you want to display in your text box as a sample. If you write `content="Enter Comments Here"`, the text box shows Enter Comments Here when the dialog opens.
* *Name*–Sets the identifying name of the element. The name provides a reference so that code, such as event handler code, can refer to it.

`<ComboBox Name="MaterialCombo" Text="{Binding Prop[Cost].Value}" Grid.Column="3" Grid.Row="6" ItemsSource="{Binding Prop[Cost].ListValues}"/>`

### Button

A button is a user interface element that provides the user a simple way to trigger an event, such as Search or Save. The button needs the Command property. This Command property identifies which action gets executed when the button is clicked.

`<Button Command="{Binding PsCmd[MyCommand]}" Grid.Column="1" Margin="0,5,0,5" Width="80">Click</Button>`

The Command is bound to the `PsCmd` keyword which helps link the command action with the given PowerShell function. It is possible to pass arguments to the function using the `CommandParameter="my args"` attribute. The argument will then be available within the function as `$dsParam` variable.

### Binding

To use one of these components to control or change a Vault file property, you need to understand `"{Binding Prop[myProp ].Value}"`.

Binding lets you map values to certain CAD or Vault properties. For example, you can bind the text of a Text Box to the Title property so that every time something is entered in this particular text box, the Title property is automatically updated. Binding is a great way to automate property changes, leaving less work for the end user

`Prop[ ]` is an essential function for binding. With it, you can access the properties of a file (CAD and Vault) or according object (folder, item, custom object, etc.). If you want to map a text box to the property Engineer, write `<TextBox text="{Binding Prop[Engineer].Value}"/>`. When the text box is created, `Prop[ ]` returns the value of that property. Every time the text box gets updated, it notifies the `Prop[ ]` function which writes the new value to the mapped file property.

## Editing XAML Files with Visual Studio

You can use Visual Studio to edit the .xaml file. Visual Studio helps you place your elements and helps you avoid spelling mistakes.

Note: Visual Studio Express for Windows or better is required for the instructions in this topic. If you don't already have Visual Studio, you can download it from Microsoft.

Example of setting up Visual Studio:

1. After Visual Studio is installed, launch the application and click the New Project field.
2. Select the WPF Application and give the new project your desired name and location. You should also set the default path, so if you want to change the Data Standard dialog more than one time you can always use that project again.

Now that you are in your new project, you should see a MainWindow.xaml tab, MainWindow.xam.cs tab, and others. You do not need the tabs, just the environment provided to edit the .xaml file. For the purposes of editing the .xaml, you want to link to the .xaml file. There is no need to bring the .xaml into the project.

1. Right click on the project in Solution Explorer and move it to Add > Existing Item.
2. Browse to the .xaml file in Solution Explorer and select Add as Link.

   Note: If you do not see the .xaml file, change the file type above the Add button.
3. Once you see the .xaml file in Solution Explorer, double-click on it.

   An Error called Problem Loading displays.
4. In the error list at the bottom of your Visual Studio window, locate the error that says that assemblies and properties or resources aren't found.
5. Go to Solution Explorer and right-click on References.
6. Select Add References.
7. Select the Browse tab and search for:

   * dataStandard.UI.DLL at this path: C:\ProgramData\Autodesk\Inventor 2018\Addins\Data Standard. Select it and click OK.
   * CreateObject.DLL at this path: C:\ProgramData\Autodesk\Vault 2018\Extensions\Data Standard. Select it and click OK.
   * Autodesk.Connectivity.Webservices.DLL at this path: C:\Program Files\Autodesk\Vault 2018\ . Select it and click OK.
8. If changes are for CAD, select the .cfg file that you want to modify in the Solution Explorer.

The dialog displays in the design window. You can select an area in the dialog and Visual Studio jumps to that part in your xaml file. Begin inserting or modifying fields. See [Data Standard Dialogs](GUID-D810F003-0EAC-4C22-841A-5FB014E4ADE7.htm) for more information.

## Add a Field to the Dialog

1. Decide where to add the new field. In which row and column should the new property show up?
2. Add a new row in the grid so that the control can be placed at that position. If a new column is needed, add a column. Go in the XAML file at the Grid control which contains the new control. For that Grid you will find `<Grid.RowDefinitions>` and `<RowDefinition .../>`. Add an additional `<RowDefinition/>` where you want the new row displayed. Set the property Height to the according value, either a fixed value or auto (for minimal space) or \* (for maximal space).
3. Add the control, such as a Label and TextBox, inside the <Grid> area near the other controls. With the attributes `Grid.Row` and `Grid.Column` you can define at which row and column the control is placed. Also define the bindings for the control, so that data can flow between the control and the property. If changes are intended for CAD, you must also configure the property in the according [CFG file](GUID-35BE7DEF-C918-4298-9606-F999F4CC4D02.htm).
4. When adding a new row, all controls that were on the same row number and below must be moved down by incrementing their `Grid.Row` attribute.

##### Disable Data Standard for Specific Inventor Commands

# Disable Data Standard for Specific Inventor Commands

You can disable Data Standard for Inventor commands that should not interact with Data Standard.

For example: The Inventor > Productivity commands Add Part and Add Assembly intend to create new component files avoiding user input; therefore these commands must not be handled by Data Standard and are added to the default configuration.

Use `DisableVDSForCmds` configuration setting.

The configuration file can be found at "C:\ProgramData\Autodesk\Inventor \Addins\Data Standard\dataStandard.InvAddIn.dll.config".

**Tip:** Use EventWatcher.exe and activate the trace of user commands. Identify the command name to be copied to the configuration file. Follow the SDK\_ReadMe instructions on how to access EventWatcher (C:\Users\Public\Documents\Autodesk\Inventor <version>\SDK\SDK\_ReadMe.htm).

Note: Unload/Load Vault Data Standard or restart Inventor after making changes to the AddIn configuration.

##### Enable Inventor Data Standard for Custom Content Center Saves

# Enable Inventor Data Standard for Custom Content Center Saves

You can use custom Content Center (CC) to change the name, properties, etc. when adding library in Inventor assembly files.

## Default Behaviour

When you add a cc part as a custom part, by default Vault file numbering and VDS save are suppressed. You can save the custom cc component to the project path. There is no file numbering and VDS interaction.

![](../images/vds-default-behaviour-1-2023.2.png)

![](../images/vds-default-behaviour-2-2023.2.png)

## **Enable Vault Numbering Only**

Configure the option to enable Vault numbering only without the need for VDS interaction.

Here, when you save a custom cc component to the project path, a Vault File Number dialog displays to propose a file name. In the Save As dialog, select the file location.

![](../images/vds-vault-numbering-1-2023.2.png)

To enable Vault numbering only, edit the configuration file to add "InteractionEvents" to `EnableVaultNumSchemeForCmds`

![](../images/vds-vault-numbering-2-2023.png)

Note:

* Before editing the configuration file, make a copy of the original configuration file and save it as 'Default'\_'Your initials'.
* Ensure you do not modify any other file except "dataStandard.InvAddIn.dll.config".
* Enable "Show hidden files, folders and drives" in the Windows File Explorer > Options to locate the folder.

  ![](../images/vds-show-hidden-files.png)

## **Enable Vault Numbering and VDS Interaction**

Configure the option to enable Vault numbering and VDS Datasheet interaction.

Here, when you save a custom cc component to the project path, Save As Dialog is part of "Place from Content Center" option. The VDS dialog overwrites both the file location (as selected in the VDS dialog) and file name with file Vault number or manual file name.

![](../images/vds-vault-numbering-vds-1-2023.2.png)

To enable VDS save dialog, remove "InteractionEvents" from `DisableVdsForCmd`

#### Data Standard Customization

# Data Standard Customization

Customize the Data Standard XAML to create your own unique Data Standard dialog.

Data Standard provides functionality to programmatically customize business logic, behavior, default values and UI. In addition, functionality to debug and trace the customization is available.

For the customization described in this section, Windows PowerShell is used. Use the embedded scripts in the Data Standard dialog to leverage features found in PowerShell. By doing so, you can further customize the Data Standard dialog so that value updates are automated.

##### Customize Data Standard Dialogs

# Customize Data Standard Dialogs

The Data Standard dialog represents the XAML file. The dialog and Vault properties can be customized before and after the dialog is opened.

The dialog type is [System.Windows.Window](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.window(v=vs.100).aspx) and can be accessed in PowerShell using the variable $dsWindow.

## Dialogs in Data Standard for Vault

The XAML definitions for the multiple dialogs of Data Standard for Vault are located in the directory:

%programdata%\Autodesk\<Vault version>\Extensions\DataStandard\Vault\Configuration

By default, one file fore each supported Vault entity is provided: File.xaml, Folder.xaml, and Task.xml.

## References

The following objects are available in the ps1 file of a Data Standard for Vault Dialog:

* $dsDiag
* $dsWindow
* $prop
* $vault
* $vaultApplication
* $vaultConnection
* $vaultExplorerUtil

## Dialogs in Data Standard for AutoCAD

The XAML definition for the single dialog of Data Standard for AutoCAD is located in the directory:

%programdata%\Autodesk\<Vault version>\Extensions\DataStandard\CAD\Configuration

For all AutoCAD Drawings, the file AutoCAD.xaml is used.

## References

The following objects are available in the ps1 file of a Data Standard for AutoCAD Dialog:

* $dsDiag
* $dsWindow
* $prop
* $vault
* $vaultConnection

## Dialogs in Data Standard for Inventor

The XAML definition for the multiple Data Standard dialogs for Inventor is located in the directory:

%programdata%\Autodesk\<Vault version>\Extensions\DataStandard\CAD\Configuration

For regular Inventor Parts, Assemblies, and Drawings, the file Inventor.xaml is used. For selected functional parts and assemblies, there are specific dialogs shown, Each dialog has its own xaml file: CableAndHarness.xaml, DesignAccelerator.xaml, FrameGenerator.xaml, TubeAndPipe.xaml

## References

The following objects are available in the ps1 file of a Data Standard for Inventor Dialog:

* $dsDiag
* $dsWindow
* $prop
* $vault
* $vaultConnection

Every ps1 file located in the Addins folder is read and used for the dialogs. So all of the code present in the ps1 files located in the Addins folder defines the behavior of the dialog.

###### Dynamic Properties

# Dynamic Properties

Dynamic Properties allow you to show and edit properties that are assigned to a Vault category without the need to modify the XAML file.

When adding new properties to a Vault category, these properties appear automatically the next time the Data Standard dialog or tab is shown.

## Use Dynamic Properties in Data Standard Dialogs and Tabs

The dynamic properties are represented by a XAML `DataGrid` control that has two columns. The first column is read-only and shows the property name. The second column is more complex because it has to display different controls for different types (e.g., **ComboBox** for properties with a predefined list of values, **DataPicker** for properties of type date).

### DataGrid Control

To add the Dynamic Properties control to dialog, the following lines are needed:

```
...
                <DataGrid x:Name="DSDynamicCategoryProperties"
                      AutoGenerateColumns="False"
                      HeadersVisibility="Column"
                      ItemsSource="{Binding DynamicProperties}"
                      ScrollViewer.CanContentScroll="False"
                      HorizontalGridLinesBrush="WhiteSmoke"
                      VerticalGridLinesBrush="WhiteSmoke">
                    <DataGrid.Columns>
                        <DataGridTextColumn Binding="{Binding Name}"
                                        SortDirection="Ascending"
                                        Width="140"
                                        IsReadOnly="True" >
                            <DataGridTextColumn.HeaderTemplate>
                                <DataTemplate>
                                    <TextBlock Text="{Binding DataContext.UIString[LBL64], RelativeSource={RelativeSource AncestorType=DataGrid}}"/>
                                </DataTemplate>
                            </DataGridTextColumn.HeaderTemplate>
                        </DataGridTextColumn>
                        <DataGridTemplateColumn CellStyle="{StaticResource DynamicDataGridCellStyle}"
                                            Width="*" >
                            <DataGridTemplateColumn.HeaderTemplate>
                                <DataTemplate>
                                    <TextBlock Text="{Binding DataContext.UIString[LBL65], RelativeSource={RelativeSource AncestorType=DataGrid}}"/>
                                </DataTemplate>
                            </DataGridTemplateColumn.HeaderTemplate>
                        </DataGridTemplateColumn>
                    </DataGrid.Columns>
                </DataGrid>
...
```

The second column uses a style `(cellstyle="{staticresourcedynamicdatagridcellstyle})` that also has to be added to the XAML file in the Resources section. This takes care of all the different controls:

```
...
  <Window.Resources>
        <Style x:Key="DynamicDataGridCellStyle" TargetType="{x:Type DataGridCell}">
            <Setter Property="Template">
                <Setter.Value>
                    <ControlTemplate>
                        <ComboBox ItemsSource="{Binding ListValues}" Text="{WPF:ValidatedBinding Value}" IsEditable="True"></ComboBox>
                    </ControlTemplate>
                </Setter.Value>
            </Setter>
            <Style.Triggers>
                <Trigger Property="IsSelected" Value="True">
                    <Setter Property="Background" Value="{DynamicResource {x:Static SystemColors.HighlightBrushKey}}"/>
                    <Setter Property="Foreground" Value="{DynamicResource {x:Static SystemColors.HighlightTextBrushKey}}"/>
                    <Setter Property="BorderBrush" Value="{DynamicResource {x:Static SystemColors.HighlightBrushKey}}"/>
                </Trigger>
                <Trigger Property="IsKeyboardFocusWithin" Value="True">
                    <Setter Property="BorderBrush" Value="{DynamicResource {x:Static DataGrid.FocusBorderBrushKey}}"/>
                </Trigger>
                <DataTrigger Binding="{Binding ListValues.Count}" Value="0">
                    <Setter Property="Template">
                        <Setter.Value>
                            <ControlTemplate>
                                <TextBox Text="{WPF:ValidatedBinding Value}"></TextBox>
                            </ControlTemplate>
                        </Setter.Value>
                    </Setter>
                </DataTrigger>
                <DataTrigger Binding="{Binding Typ}" Value="DateTime">
                    <Setter Property="Template">
                        <Setter.Value>
                            <ControlTemplate>
                                <DatePicker SelectedDate="{WPF:ValidatedBinding Value, StringFormat='dd/MM/yyyy'}"/>
                            </ControlTemplate>
                        </Setter.Value>
                    </Setter>
                </DataTrigger>
                <DataTrigger Binding="{Binding Typ}" Value="Bool">

### XAML Binding `DynamicProperties`

Look at this line of code in the previous example:

`ItemsSource="{Binding DynamicProperties}"`

This code gets a list of `IProperty` elements that are assigned to the category. The `IProperty` object has, among others, these members which can be used in bindings:

* `ListValues`–used for properties with a pre-defined list of values.
* `Name`–name of the property. The value is used for the first column.
* `Value`–to get and set the property value.

Note: In Data Standard for Vault, `DynamicProperties` returns all properties assigned to a category. Whereas for CAD, only the mapped properties are returned. This is because Data Standard for CAD does not directly change Vault Properties. Changes are done through Vault mapping.

### XAML Binding `DynamicPropertiesCategory`

In order that the `DynamicProperties` binding returns something, a Vault category has to be specified first. In the default implementation that comes with Data Standard, the `DynamicPropertiesCategory` gets specified through a combo box:

```
...
<ComboBox
    Name="Categories"
    ItemsSource="{Binding PsList[GetCategories]}"
    SelectedIndex="0"
    DisplayMemberPath="Name"
    selecteditem="{binding-dynamicpropertiescategory}"
    Text="{Binding Prop[_Category].Value}" Grid.Row="0" Grid.Column="1"
    IsEnabled="{Binding IsNewEntryDialog}">
</ComboBox>
...
```

The list of available Vault categories `(ItemsSource="{Binding PsList[GetCategories]}")` is returned by a PowerShell function `GetCategories`. In the default implementation, this just returns all categories. If only certain categories should be available (e.g., based on document type), this function has to be adjusted.

The selected category from the combo box sets the DynamicPropertiesCategory:

`(selecteditem="{binding-dynamicpropertiescategory}")`

###### Dynamic Properties - Sort Order and Visibility

# Dynamic Properties - Sort Order and Visibility

You can configure the sort order and control the visibility of properties within the Dynamic Property Category by editing respective application XML files.

There are 3 xml files, one for each Vault Data Standard:

* InventorDynamicProperties.xml
* AutocadDynamicProperties.xml
* VaultDynamicProperties.xml

These files are not installed by the installer but they are automatically generated when creating a file in Vault or saving a file in Inventor or AutoCAD for the first time when using Vault Data Standard dialog.

These files are located:

* CAD files under C:\ProgramData\Autodesk\Vault 20XX\Extensions\DataStandard\CAD.Custom\Configuration
* Vault file under C:\ProgramData\Autodesk\Vault 20XX\Extensions\DataStandard\Vault.Custom\Configuration

An administrator can change the order of the properties displayed in the VDS dialog as well as hide properties from the dialog using these XML files.

**Dynamic Properties**

Each file has a root element called `DynamicProperties` which contains `DynamicPropertiesCategory` as its children.

**DynamicPropertiesCategory**

`DynamicPropertiesCategory` represents the vault category and groups all the properties of that category.

It has two attributes:

* The ‘Category’ attribute has the value of the vault category.
* The ‘Type’ attribute may have one of the value from “File, Folder and CustomObject”. For Inventor and AutoCAD, there is no 'Type' attribute.

**DynamicProperty**

The `DynamicPropertiesCategory` contains `DynamicProperty` which corresponds with the list of properties displayed in the dynamic properties grid in the VDS dialog. `DynamicProperty` has one attribute called "Hidden" which can be set to "True" or "False". By default, all the properties don't have that attribute which means they are all visible.

**How to change order of the Properties displayed in the dialog?**

The order of the `DynamicProperty` entries inside each of the `DynamicPropertiesCategory` represents the order that you see in the VDS dialog. To change the order, move the entries up or down manually and save the file. Next time you open the dialog, properties are displayed in the specified order.

**What happens when you add/remove to/from properties to the Category?**

When you add properties to the Category in the Vault, they append to the end of the list. When you remove them, then the entry in the XXXDynamicProperties.xml remains unless removed manually from the list.

Note: Until VDS 2020.2 release, the VaultDynamicProperties.xml file was always using Name of the property in its entry and not aligned with VDS for AutoCAD and Inventor. Now the name is aligned across VDS and the entries in the xml file are exactly the same as in the dynamic properties grid. Thus we recommend to replace the existing VaultDynamicProperties.xml with the new one and bring over your changes for example the order of the properties into the new XML configuration.

###### Data Standard and Numbering Schemes

# Data Standard and Numbering Schemes

A XAML control called `DSNumSchemeCtrl` is used to support numbering schemes in Data Standard dialogs for the Vault Client, Inventor Vault Add-in, and AutoCAD Vault Add-in.

## Numbering Scheme User Interface

![](../images/numberingschemeui.png)

The following lines are required in the XAML file to show the UI controls displayed in the preceding image.

```
...
        <Label Content="{Binding UIString[LBL10]}" Grid.Column="0" Grid.Row="6" />
        <ComboBox Grid.Column="1" Grid.Row="6" Name="NumSchms" SelectedIndex="0" Style="{StaticResource NumSchmStyle}"></ComboBox>
        <Label Content="{Binding UIString[LBL31]}" Grid.Column="0" Grid.Row="8"></Label>
        <WPF:DSNumSchemeCtrl Grid.Column="1" Grid.Row="8" Name="NUMSCHEME" IsEnabled="{Binding ElementName=NumSchms, Path=IsEnabled}" Scheme="{Binding ElementName=NumSchms, Path=SelectedItem}" GeneratedNumberProperty="_GeneratedNumber" />
...
```

## Mandatory Attributes

The user control `DSNumSchemeCtrl` has two custom attributes that are mandatory.

* `Scheme`

  Use this attribute to specify the name of the numbering scheme that should be displayed in the control. In the sample, this value is bound to the selected entry in the combo box above the control. By default, the combo box contains all activated file numbering schemes. See Filtering Numbering Schemes to see how you can filter the numbering schemes.
* `GeneratedNumberProperty`

  Use this attribute to define which property holds the generated number. When clicking the OK button, the number for each `DSNumSchemeCtrl` is generated and assigned to the specified property.

  In the default sample, the value in the property `_GeneratedNumber` plus the file extension determines the filename that is used to create the new file. In the next section are samples for Vault Client and CAD that use the generated number as well as some other property values to build the filename for the new file ("Customize the Filename"). Currently one `DSNumSchemeCtrl` per dialog is supported.

See [Numbering Schemes Samples](GUID-A726B569-6C54-4835-A1E0-703995828826.htm) for examples of customized numbering schemes.

##### Customize the Data Standard MenuDefinitions.xml File

# Customize the Data Standard MenuDefinitions.xml File

Add additional Data Standard menu items to the Vault Client interface or suppress certain commands with the MenuDefinitions.xml file.

Default Data Standard Menu Options

After Autodesk Vault Data Standard is installed, additional menu commands become available after restarting the Vault Client.

* New Standard File
* New Standard Folder
* About Autodesk Vault Data Standard (under the Help menu)

Note: See the Data Standard user help for more information.

All Data Standard menu customization in the Vault Client is defined in the MenuDefinitions.xml file located at %programdata%\Autodesk\<Vault version>\Extensions\DataStandard\Vault.

Note: You must reset the Vault toolbars after restarting the Vault Client for the first time after Data Standard has been installed, or after modifiying theMenuDefinitions.xml file.

## File Elements

The definition files are in XML format. Use a text editor or an XML editor to modify element values in the file.

The MenuDefinitions.xml file has three top level components:

* Menu items (`menuitem`)
* Command Sites (`commandsite`)
* Suppressed Menu Items (`suppressmenuitems`)

## Command Sites

Contains one or more `<command site name>` elements.

Specify through the command sites in which menu the defined menu commands appear. A command site can be defined with a site component.

Sample for file context menu:

```
<CommandSite>
<FileContext Label="myMenu" DeployAsPullDown="False" Location="FileContextMenu">
<Item Name="NewFile"></Item>
<Item Name="EditFile"></Item>
</FileContext>
<FolderContex Label="myMenu" DeployAsPullDown="False" Location="FolderContextMenu">
<Item Name="NewFile"></Item>
<Item Name="NewFolder"></Item>
<Item Name="EditFolder"></Item>
</FolderContex>
<StandardToolbar Label="myMenu" DeployAsPullDown="False" Location="StandardToolbar">
<Item Name="NewFile"></Item>
<Item Name="EditFile"></Item>
</StandardToolbar>
<ToolsMenu Label="myMenu" DeployAsPullDown="False" Location="ToolsMenu">
<Item Name="ShowLog"></Item>
</ToolsMenu>
<HelpMenu Label="myMenu" DeployAsPullDown="False" Location="HelpMenu">
<Item Name="AboutDialog"></Item>
</HelpMenu>
<Task Label="Task" DeployAsPullDown="False" Location="Task">
<Item Name="NewTask"></Item>
<Item Name="EditTask"></Item>
</Task>
</CommandSite>
```

The available attributes for CommandSite <command site name> element are shown in the following table.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Attribute | Required | Valid Values | Description |
| Label | No | Characters and Numbers | Text displayed in the pulldown menu. If it doesn’t exists then ‘mymenu’ is used. |
| DeployAsPullDown | No | True or False | If True, pull down menu is created on the context menu with label defined above. |
| Location | Yes | Characters and Numbers | Text representing the tooltip for the command. |

The CommandSite element contains one or more  which corresponds to the elements defined in the MenuItem elements.

The only attribute for the  element is Name.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Attribute | Required | Valid Values | Description |
| Name | Yes | Name of the element defined in the MenuItem elements. | Name of the element defined in the MenuItem elements |

## Suppressed Menu Items

By default, the New Folder command is removed from the file and right-click menus when Data Standard is installed. Administrators can remove additional default commands from the Vault user interface by modifying the `suppressmenuitems` section in the MenuDefinitions.xml file.

```
<SuppressMenuItems>
NewFolder,NewFolderGroupMenu,NewFolderGroupButton,NewFolderForContextMenus
</SuppressMenuItems>
```

The command names are separated by a comma.

Example:

* To suppress the New Library Folder command, add these two commands to the `SuppressMenuItems` list: `NewLibraryFolder`, `NewLibraryFolderForContextMenus`.
* To suppress Rename Folder, add this command: `Folder.Rename`.
* Undo Suppress Commands:

  1. To stop suppressing a command, remove the command name(s) from the `suppressMenuItems` section.
  2. Restart Vault to see your changes.

##### Enable Vault Numbering scheme for Specific Inventor Commands

# Enable Vault Numbering scheme for Specific Inventor Commands

You can enable back the Vault’s numbering scheme dialog for Inventor commands.

Certain workflows require to retrieve numbers before the Vault Data Standard dialog and numbering mechanism is initialized.

Use `EnableVaultNumSchemeForCmds` configuration setting.

The configuration settings are loaded only if the Data Standard add-in loads using the Add-In Manager.

The configuration file can be found at "C:\ProgramData\Autodesk\ApplicationPlugins\VDSI<version>.bundle\Contents\dataStandard.InvAddIn.dll.config".

**Notes:**

* If the numbering scheme dialog is enabled, numbers are reserved and pre-set as file name in Inventor; to support this behavior custom Data Standard dialogs must not use the numbering scheme control object.
* The configuration settings are loaded only if the Data Standard add-in loads using the Add-In Manager.
* Commands added to section <DisableVDSForCmds> should also be added in the `EnableVaultNumSchemeForCmds` section if Vault Numbering scheme should be enabled as well.

##### Property Constraints and Validation

# Property Constraints and Validation

Data Standard leverages the property constraints configured in property definitions.

**Constraints**

You can add custom properties, and modify or override existing property constraints from Vault.

To modify constraints, use for example `$Prop["Title"].IsObligatory = $true`.

To add properties, use `$Prop["CustomProperty"].Value = "somevalue"`. For Inventor and AutoCAD, the new property will be saved as custom property when you save the document.

1. In the Default.ps1 file, add the new required property, for example: $Prop["SomeProperty"].IsObligatory = $true
2. Open a Data Standard client in Vault, Inventor or AutoCAD.
3. Display the Data Standard dialog.
4. The edited field with the required property is highlighted in red border indicating that the input is necessary.

**Validation**

You can add custom validation to properties. This allows to validate against custom constraints defined in particular functions.

To add a custom validation, use `$Prop["CustomProperty"].CustomValidation = { MyValidation }`. The function “MyValidation” has to return $true or $false, based on your custom constraints.

**Validation - Examples**

CAD: Review the powerShell script .\CAD\addins\FileNameValidation.ps1 installed with Vault Data Standard Inventor / AutoCAD.

Vault: Review sample code in the configuration - [Example–Add Custom Validation for FolderNames](GUID-1FE5AF32-38BB-48D2-9E90-657AEF8F6063.htm).

Note: You can still use the legacy behavior for CAD to configure additions/overrides in the property section of CFG files. For Vault, the new custom validation functions are another customization layer and can be used in addition to the existing function “Validate”. Click here for additional constraints on the $Prop object.

##### Edit Data Standard Files

# Edit Data Standard Files

1. Copy the original file to be edited to the Vault.Custom\Configuration, or CAD.Custom\Configuration section.
2. Edit the copy instead of the original/default file. Vault Data Standard will always load the override files (\*.Custom\\*), if they exist.

##### Data Standard Custom Tabs

# Data Standard Custom Tabs

The Data Standard custom tab represents a XAML file to extend a tab in Vault. The type of dialog is System.Windows.Controls.UserControl and can be accessed in PowerShell using the variable `$dsWindow`.

## Custom Tabs in Data Standard for Vault

XAML definitions for each entity type which uses a Data Standard dialog custom tab are located in these directories:

* %programdata%\Autodesk\<Vault version>\Extensions\DataStandard\Vault\Configuration\Task
* %programdata%\Autodesk\<Vault version>\Extensions\DataStandard\Vault\Configuration\Eco
* %programdata%\Autodesk\<Vault version>\Extensions\DataStandard\Vault\Configuration\File
* %programdata%\Autodesk\<Vault version>\Extensions\DataStandard\Vault\Configuration\Folder
* %programdata%\Autodesk\<Vault version>\Extensions\DataStandard\Vault\Configuration\Item

Every XAML file in these folders represents a custom tab that is added on Vault startup to the existing tab controls (e.g., History, Uses, Where Used and so on for files, Reports and Datasheet for folders, etc.).

Note: To show custom tabs for your own custom object type, create a separate folder with the name of custom object. See [Custom Objects](GUID-E1BA9E4A-443F-43EA-B8BF-3CAA382C25A3.htm) for more information.

## Create a Data Standard Custom Tab

To add your own Custom Tabs to Vault, copy the folder (e.g. File if your custom tab is used for files) to the Vault.Custom\Customization\ folder.

The excerpt below shows the typical header of a XAML file for a tab. You can see that controls like `TextBox` and `Label` have default settings. For example, all `TextBox` controls are set to read only, meaning that the data in the tab is displayed but cannot be edited. Another default setting is the ScrollViewer, which makes tabs scrollable if the window is too small. The starting point for the layout is the `<Grid>` section.

```
<UserControl xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
             xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
             xmlns:behaviours="clr-namespace:Common.Wpf;assembly=Common"
             behaviours:TabTitleBehavior.TabTitle="$UIString[LBL36]"
            x:Name="MainWindow">
    <UserControl.Resources>
        <Style TargetType="{x:Type TextBox}" BasedOn="{StaticResource {x:Type TextBox}}">
            <Setter Property="IsReadOnly" Value="True" />
            <Setter Property="VerticalAlignment" Value="Center" />
            <Setter Property="Background" Value="#F0F0F0" />
            <Setter Property="Margin" Value="0,5,0,5" />
        </Style>
        <Style TargetType="{x:Type Label}">
            <Style.Triggers>
                <DataTrigger Binding="{Binding RelativeSource={RelativeSource Self}, Path=Content}" Value="{x:Null}">
                    <Setter Property="BorderThickness" Value="1"></Setter>
                    <Setter Property="BorderBrush" Value="#ff0000"></Setter>
                </DataTrigger>
            </Style.Triggers>
        </Style>
    </UserControl.Resources>
    <ScrollViewer VerticalScrollBarVisibility="Auto" HorizontalScrollBarVisibility="Auto">
        <Grid>
```

## Reference

The following objects are available in the Data Standard Custom Tab ps1 file:

* `$dsDiag`
* `$dsWindow`
* `$vault`
* `$vaultApplication`
* `$vaultConnection`

Every ps1 file located in the Addins folder is read and used for the tabs. So all of the code present in the ps1 files located in the Addins folder defines the behaviour of the tab.

##### Data Standard Debugging

# Data Standard Debugging

Monitor the behavior of Data Standard and identify malfunctions so you can correct the code.

There are two methods that help you review and debug your code. The first method is the log file which is generated in the c:\temp folder (datastandard<app>log.txt). The second method is logging within the code via the `$dsDiag` object.

## Log Files

Under c:\temp there are up to 3 log files: dataStandardVaultlog.txt, dataStandardInventorlog.txt, dataStandardAutoCADlog.txt. Each log file corresponds to the according application where Data Standard runs.

One issue that sometimes happens with Data Standard, is that after a change is made to the XAML file, the dialog does not show up, or in case of CAD, the standard application save dialog appears instead of the Data Standard dialog. This usually is a symptom of a typo in the XAML file. In such cases you'll find in the respective log file an error message like `'System.Windows.Markup.XamlParseException`'.

The `XamlParseException` error is typical when there is mistake in the code that causes load or interpretation failure. Usually this error is accompanied by the line and the position of where the interpretation of the file failed, like this:

```
"System.Windows.Markup.XamlParseException: ......... Line 14, position 9. --->"
```

Usually the error is not exactly at that position but somewhat before. However, if you see this message, check your XAML syntax around the given line and position.

When encountering an error, always check the log file.

## Logging

Within your PowerShell code, you can add logging information that might be useful for debugging your code in case of errors. For this purpose, the object `$dsDiag` provides methods like `ShowLog()` for opening a log window and `Trace("hello")` for writing something into the log window.

Additionally, it's possible to stop the code at a certain position and show up a little dialog that shows all the variables available and set at that time. This is done via `Inspect()`.

To view the log window, open it with the `InitializeWindow` function, which is called right before the dialog shows up. Add these lines to the `InitializeWindow` function:

`$dsDiag.ShowLog()`

`$dsDiag.Clear()`

This will open the log window and clear the content.

Later you can add `$dsDiag.Trace("my comments")` in your code at different locations with according messages, so that you can follow in the log window how far your function comes. It's a good practice to add a "function start" and "function end" trace message at the beginning and end of each function, so that it becomes easy to follow the procedure call in the log window. Like this:

```
function myFunc
{
  $dsDiag.Trace(">> myFunc")
  ... here comes your code ...
  $dsDiag.Trace("<< myFunc")
}
```

Whether you use the >> and << as a symbol to entering and exiting a function, or you just write start-end, it's up to you.

If you want to know the exact state of the art of the variables at a given time, just add the `$dsDiag.Inspect()`. The code will hold at that time of execution, and in the dialog that shows up, the variables available with the given value are displayed. As the dialog usually shows up at the left side of the screen, make sure your Data Standard dialog is placec to the right, so that it does not overlap the inspector dialog.

Opening the inspector dialog within event handlers is a bit risky, so use logging in these cases.

##### Vault Data Standard and FDU (Factor Design Utilities)

# Vault Data Standard and FDU (Factor Design Utilities)

Factory Design Utilities is an interoperable 2D and 3D factory layout and optimization solution that is used to design and communicate efficient layouts by creating a digital model of your factory.

With Factory Design, you can easily generate layout designs in AutoCAD by using the 2D asset library. At any time, your design can sync to Inventor. Corresponding 3D assets are then automatically populated over their 2D counterparts. More assets can be placed, and alterations can be made in the 3D layout. At any point, the 3D assembly can sync back to the original 2D drawing, updating all the AutoCAD drawings with the changes you made in the 3D model.

**Important:**

* **When synchronizing the files from AutoCAD to Inventor**, 2D and 3D layouts must have the same name and the folder location. Simply select the same folder location in Vault Data Standard for Inventor that you applied before in Vault Data Standard for AutoCAD. Do not specify another file number but leave the pre-set file name instead.

  Note: The Inventor 3D to AutoCAD 2D synchronization is a background only process and does not offer any file save dialog.
* Vault Data Standard is configured not to interact with Factory Asset Builder workflows, therefore Data Standard does not initialize using Asset Builder Save, Edit, or Publish commands. If you see that default settings are changed, contact your administrator.

###### Example--Adding a Field to a Data Standard Dialog

# Example--Adding a Field to a Data Standard Dialog

Add a property called Company to the Data Standard for Vault dialog.

1. Open File.XAML (C:\ProgramData\Autodesk\Vault 2016\Extensions\DataStandard\Vault\Configuration) as a link in Visual Studio.
2. Go to the Grid where you want to add the control
3. Add a `RowDefinition` in the list of `<Grid.RowDefinitions>`. Set the height to 'auto' so that the row adjusts to be as high as the control requires.
4. Locate where the other controls are defined. Add a Label and a TextBox. Where these controls are place is not relevant. The row attribute defines where the control is displayed in the dialog. However, Autodesk recommends that you keep the sort order of the controls, so it becomes easier to find them later.
5. Set the Content attribute for the label to the text that want to display in the dialog (e.g., Company Name). Bind the Text attribute to the property Company like this: `Test={Binding Prop[Company].Value}`
6. Set the `Grid.Row` and `Grid.Column` attributes to the column and row where the control is displayed
7. You may have to update the `Grid.Row` and `Grid.Column` attributes of the other controls so that they show up in the right location and do not overlap your controls.
8. Save the file and create a new file in Vault. The dialog should now show the new property

The same operation can be applied to any other dialog. In case of the CAD dialogs, just keep in mind to also define the property in the according CFG file and to restart the CAD application so that the property is loaded.

###### Example–Creating Cascading Combo Boxes for the Data Standard Dialog

# Example–Creating Cascading Combo Boxes for the Data Standard Dialog

Create multiple combo-boxes (also known as selection lists) for your Data Standard dialogs, where the next combo box depends on the selection made in the first combo box.

When a value is selected in the first box, the next box should show values based on the first selection. For example, you have two combo boxes: one shows car company names (BMW, Mercedes, Ferrari, etc.) and the second shows car types for the selected company (for BMW: 1, 2, 5, X2, X5...; for Mercedes: A, B, C, CL, CLS...).

## Create a Combo Box

There are four parts to creating a combo box.

1. Create a Data Source

   You need a source where the data should come from to populate the combo box. As WPF comes with a native XML engine, you can create an XML file that contains the data. The XML file has the first level content for the first selection. Every entry has child entries for the second selection. These second entries could have even more children in case you need a third level or even more nested selection list.

   This is how it looks:

   ![](../images/combo-box-lists.png)

   Create a data.xml file, copy this content into the file, and save the file to the desired location. (For this example, save the Data.xml file to C:\Temp).
2. Add the data.xml as a resource to the Data Standard .xaml file. This enables that the combo boxes can use the data.

   Add the following lines to the Resource section in your .xaml file:

   ```
   <XmlDataProvider x:Key="comboDataSource" Source="C:\Temp\data.xml"/>
   ```

   This is how the whole resource section might look:

   ```
   <WPF:DSWindow.Resources xmlns:prop="clr-namespace:dataStandard.UI.View;assembly=dataStandard.UI">
       ...
       <XmlDataProvider x:Key="comboDataSource" Source="C:\Temp\data.xml"/>
   </WPF:DSWindow.Resources>
   ```

   The new resource is named `comboDataSource` and the path points to the data.xml.
3. Create the combo boxes and have them point to the first level of data in the XML and to the corresponding second level.

   Here is an example of the first combo box:

   ```
   <ComboBox x:Name="ComboCarCompanies" Grid.Column="1" Grid.Row="6"
       ItemsSource="{Binding Source={StaticResource comboDataSource}, XPath=Data/Companies/Car}" Text="{Binding Prop[CarType].Value}"
       DisplayMemberPath="@Type" SelectedValue="{Binding Prop[CarType].Value}" SelectedValuePath="@Type"/>
   ```

   The `Source` of the first combo box is set to the `StaticResource-comboDataSource` that we have defined earlier.

   The second combo box looks like this:

   ```
   <ComboBox x:Name="ComboCarType" Grid.Column="1" Grid.Row="7"
       ItemsSource="{Binding SelectedItem, ElementName=ComboCarCompanies}" Text="{Binding Prop[CarType].Value}"
       DisplayMemberPath="@Type" SelectedValue="{Binding Prop[CarType].Value}" SelectedValuePath="@Type"/>
   ```

   Most attributes in our example play the same role as in the first combo. The real difference is in the `ItemSource`. In this example, the `ItemSource` comes from `SelectedItem` of the first combo called `ComboCarCompanies`.
4. Define the property definitions `CarType` and `Car`: In the Inventor.cfg or AutoCAD.cfg depending what tool you are using for this example, add the property definitions for `CarType` and `Car`. See here for [adding property definitions in the configuration file](GUID-35BE7DEF-C918-4298-9606-F999F4CC4D02.htm).

   Note: From VDS 2019 and onwards, this step can be avoided as the VDS internally creates a property definition for those that do not exist.
5. Save your changes and review the dialog.

###### Example–Load Different Data Standard Dialogs

# Example–Load Different Data Standard Dialogs

The XAML files for the File, Folder, and Custom Object entities are pre-configured. However, more XAML files can be created in this directory and different XAML files can be shown for the same entity.

To show different dialogs for the same entity, create a PowerShell file with the content in this directory: %programdata%\Autodesk\Vault [edition]\Extensions\DataStandard\Vault\addinVault\Menus.

**Example of a Custom XAML File**

```
$vaultContext.ForceRefresh = $true
$currentSelected = $vaultContext.CurrentSelectionSet[0]
$folderid = $currentSelected.Id
#if selected object is of type 'FILE' then use $vaultContext.NavSelectionSet[0].Id,
#it will give you back the folder Id where this file is located
if ($currentselected.typeid.entityclassid--eq-"file")
{
    $folderid = $vaultContext.NavSelectionSet[0].Id
}

$xamlFile = New-Object CreateObject.WPF.XamlFile "MyOwnXaml", "C:\ProgramData\Autodesk\Vault [edition]\Extensions\DataStandard\Vault\Configuration\myfile.xaml"
$dialog = $dsCommands.GetCreateDialog($folderid)
$dialog.XamlFile = $xamlFile

#new file can be found in $dialog.CurrentFile
$result = $dialog.Execute()
$dsDiag.Trace($result)

if ($result)
{
    $folder = $vault.DocumentService.GetFolderById($folderid)
    $path=$folder.FullName+"/"+$dialog.CurrentFile.Name

    $selectionId = [Autodesk.Connectivity.Explorer.Extensibility.SelectionTypeId]::File
    $location = New-Object Autodesk.Connectivity.Explorer.Extensibility.LocationContext $selectionId, $path

    #$dsDiag.Inspect()
    $vaultContext.GoToLocation = $location
}
```

Once the dialog loads (by **$dialog.Execute()**) it can be managed using Data Standard Functions. For more information on how to execute the code in the sample above, see Menu Items.

###### Sample–Using Numbering Schemes in Data Standard Dialogs

# Sample–Using Numbering Schemes in Data Standard Dialogs

Leverage Vault numbering schemes to enforce file names when a user creates a new Data Standard file.

## Filtering Numbering Schemes

In the installed sample, the Number Scheme combo box shows all activated numbering schemes. In the XAML file, the combo box is bound to a PowerShell function called `GetNumSchms`.

![](../images/filternumberingschemescode.png)

The `GetNumSchms` function makes it easy to control which schemes should be shown to the user.

Filtering Numbering Schemes in Inventor Based on File Type

Without Data Standard, the user can always select between all activated Vault numbering schemes. With the following implementation of `GetNumSchms`, different schemes will be available for components (IPT, IAM) and drawings (IDW, IPN and DWG). To make the sample work, numbering schemes that start with COMP or DRAWING need to be defined in Vault:

**C:\ProgramData\Autodesk\<Vault Version>\Extensions\DataStandard\CAD\addinVault\Default.ps1**

```
...
function GetNumSchms
{
    try
    {
        $numSchems = $vault.DocumentService.GetNumberingSchemesByType('activated')
    }
    catch [System.Exception]
    {      
        #[System.Windows.MessageBox]::Show($error)
    }
    $filename = $Prop["DocNumber"].Value
    $fileExt = [System.IO.Path]::GetExtension($filename)
    $ret = @()
    foreach ($item-in-$numschems)
    {
        if (($fileExt -eq ".iam" -or $fileExt -eq ".ipt") -and $item.Name.StartsWith("COMP"))
        {
            $ret += $item.Name
        }
        elseif (($fileExt -eq ".idw" -or $fileExt -eq ".ipn" -or $fileExt -eq ".dwg") -and $item.Name.StartsWith("DRAWING"))
        {
            $ret += $item.Name
        }
    }
    return $ret
}
...
```

## Customize the File Name

### Data Standard for Vault

Consider you have the following numbering scheme called TestScheme.

![](../images/editnumberingschemedialog.png)

Now you want to pre-pend the filename with a fixed text based on the selected document type:

* `ENG-` for Inventor assemblies and parts (e.g., ENG-A-00004.ipt)
* `ENGDOC-` for AutoCAD/Inventor drawings and Inventor presentations (e.g., ENGDOC-B-00001.idw).
* `OFF-` for all other files (e.g., OFF-C-00002.docx).

When clicking OK in the Create File Dialog (New Standard File), the PowerShell function `GetNewFileName` is called before adding the file to Vault. Here you have the chance to modify the filename and include information from other properties.

**C:\ProgramData\Autodesk\<Vault Version>\Extensions\DataStandard\Vault\addinVault\Default.ps1**

```
...
function GetNewFileName
{
    $prefix = ""
    if($dswindow.findname("NUMSCHEME").IsEnabled -eq $false)
    {  
        $filename = $dswindow.findname("filename").Text
    }
    else{
        $filename = $Prop["_GeneratedNumber"].Value
        if (($Prop["_FileExt"].Value -eq ".ipt") -or ($Prop["_FileExt"].Value -eq ".iam"))
        {
            $prefix = "ENG-"
        }
        elseif (($Prop["_FileExt"].Value -eq ".dwg") -or ($Prop["_FileExt"].Value -eq ".idw") -or ($Prop["_FileExt"].Value -eq ".ipn"))
        {
            $prefix = "ENGDOC-"
        }
        else
        {
            $prefix = "OFF-"
        }
    }
    $newfileName = $prefix + $filename + $Prop["_FileExt"].Value
    return $newfileName
}
```

### Data Standard for CAD

With Data Standard for Inventor and AutoCAD, you can configure a combination of property values and a generated number for the filename.

For example, let's say that you want to automatically create unique file names in the format of: *N-<Title>-####.ipt* where *N-* is always applied, *<Title>* is the user-entered Title property, *####* is a number automatically generated, and *.ipt* is the file extension.

This can be done by modifying the element `<FileNameDefinition>` in Inventor.cfg or the AutoCAD.cfg files.

**C:\ProgramData\Autodesk\<Vault Version>\Extensions\DataStandard\CAD\Inventor.cfg**

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Configuration>
    <PathDefinition>{Workspace}\{Prop[Folder].Value}</PathDefinition>
    <FileNameDefinition>N-{Prop[Title].Value}-{Prop[DocNumber].Value}</FileNameDefinition>
    <PropertyDefinitions>
        <PropertyDefinition PropertyName="DocNumber" DataType="Text" InitialValue="{PathAndFileNameHandler.FileName}" />
...
```

The property `DocNumber` contains the generated number, because it is defined in attribute `GeneratedNumberProperty="DocNumber"` in the `DSNumSchemeCtrl` control of the Inventor.xaml file.

## Use Vault Numbering without Showing the Number Scheme Control in the Dialog

By removing the `DSNumSchemeCtrl` and the `NumSchms` combo box from the default File.xaml file, the user cannot select a numbering scheme anymore.

### Data Standard for Vault

The following sample implementation of `GetNewFileName` uses the numbering scheme TestScheme from above and the value entered in the Title as a parameter for the numbering scheme.

**C:\ProgramData\Autodesk\<Vault Version>\Extensions\DataStandard\Vault\addinVault\Default.ps1**

```
...
function GetNewFileName
{
    $numSchemes = $vault.DocumentService.GetNumberingSchemesByType([Autodesk.Connectivity.WebServices.NumSchmType]::Activated)
    $testNumScheme = $numSchemes | Where-Object { $_.Name.Equals("testscheme") }
    $NumGenArgs = @()
    $NumGenArgs += $Prop["Title"].Value
    $genNum = $vault.DocumentService.GenerateFileNumber($testnumscheme.schmid,-$numgenargs)
    return $genNum + $Prop["_FileExt"].Value
}
...
```

### Data Standard for CAD

For Inventor and AutoCAD, the implementation is similar to the sample above. But instead of returning a filename, the property `DocNumber` has to be filled with a generated number. This property is then used to set the name for the current file:

**C:\ProgramData\Autodesk\<Vault Version>\Extensions\DataStandard\CAD\addinVault\Default.ps1**

```
...
function OnPostCloseDialog
{
    if ($Prop["_CreateMode"].Value)
    {
        $numSchemes = $vault.DocumentService.GetNumberingSchemesByType([Autodesk.Connectivity.WebServices.NumSchmType]::Activated)
        $testNumScheme = $numSchemes | Where-Object { $_.Name.Equals("testscheme") }
        $NumGenArgs = @()
        $NumGenArgs += $Prop["Title"].Value
        $genNum = $vault.DocumentService.GenerateFileNumber($testnumscheme.schmid,-$numgenargs)
        $Prop["DocNumber"].Value = $genNum
    }
}
...
```

###### Example–Setting Title Property Values in a Data Standard Dialog

# Example–Setting Title Property Values in a Data Standard Dialog

If you want to set title properties before the Data Standard Dialog first displays, you can add code within the `InitializeWindow` function.

## Set the Property Title

Set the value of the property you are looking for with the desired.

```
function InitializeWindow
{
 $Prop["Title"].Value = "my title"
}
```

## Set a Title Property for the File Dialog Only (Vault Client)

If you want to set a property title only for the file dialog and not for other dialogs, such as folder or custom object, specify the dialog name of the `$dsWindow`.

```
function InitializeWindow
{ 
  if ($dswindow.name--eq-"filewindow")
  {
   $Prop["Title"].Value = "my title"
  }
}
```

## Set a Title Property Only on Creation

If you want to set a title property only when a new data standard file is created, but not when one is edited, specify the create object in your code.

The object names are different, depending on whether you are creating a new Data Standard file with the vault-client or with AutoCAD or Inventor.

### Set a Title Property for New Data Standard Files in AutoCAD or Inventor

```
function InitializeWindow
{ 
  if ($Prop["_CreateMode"].Value -eq $true)
  {
   $Prop["Title"].Value = "my title"
  }
}
```

### Set a Title Property for New Data Standard Files in the Vault Client

```
function InitializeWindow
{ 
  $dialogName = $dsWindow.DataContext.GetType().Name
  if($dialogname--eq-"createfileviewmodel")
  {
   $Prop["Title"].Value = "my title"
  }
}
```

###### Example–Show or Hide Controls Dynamically in the Data Standard Dialog

# Example–Show or Hide Controls Dynamically in the Data Standard Dialog

It's possible to show/hide and enable/disable controls via PowerShell code.

For example, you can show/hide or enable/disable controls for certain file types, or depending on the value of another property.

The controls can be manipulated at any time in the PowerShell code. Access these controls via the function `$dsWindow.FindName("thenameofyourcontrol")`. A prerequisite for this capaibility is that your control exposes an attribute Name with a unique name.

## Example

For this example, we will disable the Title textbox when editing a file. The TextBox for the property title will get the Name `txtTitle`, like this:

```
<TextBox Name="txttitle" ....
```

Inside the `InitializeWindow`, we will check whether the dialog is a file dialog and if it's in edit mode.

```
function InitializeWindow
{
  $dialogName = $dsWindow.DataContext.GetType().Name
  if($dialogname--eq-"fileviewmodel"--and-$dswindow.name--eq-"filewindow")
  {
    $dsWindow.FindName("txttitle").IsEnabled=$false
  }
}
```

As you can see, with `FindName("nameofthecontrol")`, we can access the `IsEnabled` property, or all of the other properties that this type of control might offer.

The same technique can be applied within event handlers to influence the behavior of each control while the user is entering data.

**CAD Example**

In the case of CAD, the syntax is the same except for the check whether the dialog is in create or edit mode.

Inside the `InitializeWindow` we check whether the dialog is a file dialog and if it's in edit mode:

```
function InitializeWindow 
{
  $dialogName = $dsWindow.DataContext.GetType().Name
  if($Prop["_EditMode"].Value -eq $true)
  {
    $dsWindow.FindName("txttitle").IsEnabled=$false 
  }
}

###### Example–Using Events with the Data Standard Dialog

# Example–Using Events with the Data Standard Dialog

Invoke events when a value changes in the Data Standard dialog. These events can be used to call scripts.

## How to Use an Event

It is important to understand the code segments that are embedded in Data Standard.

Events can be added to a property so that every time the event happens, a script function executes. Following are some example lines:

```
$Prop["Company"].add_PropertyChanged({
param(-$parameter,-$source)
if($source.propertyname--eq-"value") {
Company_OnPropertyChanged }
})
```

A property must be selected to add the event. In the code above, the function `.add_PropertyChanged()` adds the event, but the function requires one parameter. This parameter begins with a brace `{`. The parameters that the script function needs mut be declared.

The second part of the code is the function named `Company_OnPropertyChanged`. Company is the `PropertyName`. In the following lines of code, the function makes a control named ADVANCED visible if something is entered in the Company field, or collapses the control if the field is empty.

```
function Company_OnPropertyChanged
{
  if($Prop["Company"].Value -eq "")
  {
    $dsWindow.findName("advanced").Visibility = "visible"
  }
  else
  {
    $dsWindow.findName("advanced").Visibility = "collapsed"
  }
}
```

Property triggers are best defined in the `InitializeWindow` function.

###### Example–Add Custom Validation for FolderNames

# Example–Add Custom Validation for FolderNames

**Task:** Check new folder names that don’t exist on current level.

**Solution:**

1. Add a custom validation `$Prop["_FolderName"].CustomValidation` in the function InitializeWindow, section FolderWindow:

   ```
   function InitializeWindow
   {
       …
       $mWindowName = $dsWindow.Name
       Switch (-$mwindowname)
       {
           "FileWindow"
           {
               #rules applying for File
           }
           "FolderWindow"
           {
               #rules applying for Folder
               $Prop["_FolderName"].CustomValidation = { FolderNameCustomValidation }
           }
           …
   ```
2. Add the function “FolderNameCustomValidation” and related search for folders:

```
function FolderNameCustomValidation
{
    if(-not-$dswindow.findname("DSNumSchmsCtrl").NumSchmFieldsEmpty)
    {
        return $true
    }
    if($Prop["_FolderName"].Value)
    {
        $rootFolder = $vault.DocumentService.GetFolderByPath($Prop["_FolderPath"].Value)
        $mfldexist = mFindFolder $Prop["_FolderName"].Value $rootFolder
        if($mfldexist)
        {
            $Prop["_FolderName"].CustomValidationErrorMessage = "Folder name exists, select a new unique one."
            return $false
        }
        return $true
    }
    else
    {
        return $false
    }
}

function mFindFolder($foldername,-$rootfolder)
{
    $FolderPropDefs = $vault.PropertyService.GetPropertyDefinitionsByEntityClassId("fldr")
    $FolderNamePropDef = $FolderPropDefs | where {$_.SysName -eq "Name"}
    $srchCond = New-Object 'Autodesk.Connectivity.WebServices.SrchCond'
    $srchCond.PropDefId = $FolderNamePropDef.Id
    $srchCond.PropTyp = "SingleProperty"
    $srchCond.SrchOper = 3 #is equal
    $srchCond.SrchRule = "Must"
    $srchCond.SrchTxt = $FolderName

    $bookmark = ""
    $status = $null
    $totalResults = @()
    while ($status--eq-$null--or-$totalresults.count--lt-$status.totalhits)
    {
        $results = $vault.DocumentService.FindFoldersBySearchConditions(@($srchCond),$null, @($rootFolder.Id), $false, [ref]$bookmark, [ref]$status)

        if ($results--ne-$null)
        {
            $totalResults += $results
        }
        else {break}
    }
    return $totalResults;
}
```

1. Update the Dialog definition File.xaml: Navigate to the Textbox "FILENAME" and update the binding `Text="{WPF:ValidatedBinding Name}"` to `Text="{WPF:ValidatedBinding Prop[_FolderName].Value}"`. The new TextBox definition looks like this:

```
<TextBox Text="{WPF:ValidatedBinding Prop[_FolderName].Value}" x:Name="FOLDERNAME" 
                     IsReadOnly="{Binding EditMode}"
                     Visibility="{Binding NumSchmFieldsEmpty, ElementName=DSNumSchmsCtrl, Converter={StaticResource BooleanToVisibilityConverter}}" 
                     Grid.Column="1" Grid.Row="3" />

### Fine-Tune Searches with the Search Slop Factor

# Fine-Tune Searches with the Search Slop Factor

In addition to understanding and leveraging the basics of search tokens and search properties to return more accurate Vault searches (see-searching-a-vault), administrators can also manipulate the "range" of Vault search results users receive by modifying the Lucene "search slop factor" in the web.config file.

The "search slop factor" determines how many positions can occur between any two terms in your search phrase and still be considered a match. These positions range from an exact match of your search string to a number of combinations of this string.

The "slop" is an edit-distance, where the distance units are the number of moves the tokens in the query phrase can shift out of position and still be captured in the search. For example, to switch the order of two words in your search requires two moves. The first move places the words atop one another, and the second move re-orders them. So, to permit re-orderings of search strings with two words or tokens, the slop must be set to at least 2.

In simple terms, the slop factor decides how out of order search tokens are permitted to be before they are excluded from search results. By default more exact matches are given precedence, but the total number of search results can be directly affected by this value.

## Configure the Slop Factor

1. From the Web.config file (C:\Program Files\Autodesk\Vault Server 20xx), locate the following two lines:

   ```
   !-- slop factor provided to lucene search -->

   <add key="SearchSlopFactor" value="10" />
   ```
2. Modify the "SearchSlopFactor" value on the ADMS server to change the results returned by a given search. Depending on the changes you make, you will have a more refined or open set of search results.

   By default the slop value is set to 10. You can set this value as low as 0 for exact matches only or increase this range to whichever value you desire.

   Note: Keep in mind how these changes affect the user search experience. If the value is too low, users may become frustrated at not finding the correct data. If the value is too high, users may have too many search results to sort through.

Example 1: Searching with Multiple Tokens

Let's say I want to search for file A-055401-321.ipt. This search is represented by six (6) search tokens:

![](../images/slopfactor-table-tokenbreakdown.png)

If I enter **A-055\*** as my search criteria and the slop factor is set to 10, I receive any number of additional results similar to the following which meet the slop factor settings:

![](../images/slopfactor-example1-a.png)

If I enter A-055\* as my search criteria but the **Slop Factor = 6**, the exact same results are returned because the tokens are still within the "edit distance" set by the slop factor.

![](../images/slopfactor-example1-b.png)

However, if I enter **A-055\*** as my search criteria but the **Slop Factor = 4**, the results are reduced to 5. The reason I no longer get B-055401-321.ipt in my results is because the tokens in B-055401-321-A.ipt are spread too far apart to meet the slop restriction or edit distance. Starting from the first dash we would have to move "A" 5 positions to match A-055\*.

![](../images/slopfactor-example1-c.png)

If I enter **A-055\*** as my search criteria but the **Slop Factor = 2**, there are only 4 results.

Note: A setting of 2 is the minimum value for the system to return search tokens out of order.

B-321-055401-A.ipt is omitted as the "A" would need to move 3 positions to match the search phrase A-055\*.

![](../images/slopfactor-example1-d.png)

Finally, if I enter **A-055\*** as my search criteria but the **Slop Factor = 0**, only exact token matches are returned.

![](../images/slopfactor-example1-e.png)

Example 2: Searching with Fewer Tokens

What happens if I repeat the search with fewer tokens? This time I will search for **A055\***.

Note: The dash is removed and, therefore, the number of tokens is reduced.

If I enter **A055\*** as my search criteria with **Slop Factor = 5**, I receive 6 results because I have effectively reduced the number of positions required to move the tokens for a match. The slop factor does not need to be as high to return 6 results:

![](../images/slopfactor-example2-a.png)

If I enter **A055\*** as my search criteria with Slop Factor = 3, I receive 5 results. Once again, the edit distance is shorter than it was in the previous example, but the results are the same with B-055401-321-A.ipt being excluded:

![](../images/slopfactor-example2-b.png)

If I enter **A055\*** as my search criteria with **Slop Factor = 1**, there are only 2 results.

![](../images/slopfactor-example2-c.png)

However now with the "-" character removed, my search for file names containing **A055\*** with **Slop Factor = 0** yields NO results–there are no exact matches in this case.

#### Troubleshooting with Vault Client Diagnostic Log Files

# Troubleshooting with Vault Client Diagnostic Log Files

Learn where to collect diagnostic information for the Vault Client.

For the purposes of this section, we refer to the %temp% folder. This is the temp folder location defined for the Windows user account that is logged in on the computer.

By default, the location of the folder is: C:\Users\ACCOUNTNAME\AppData\Local\Temp.

In this example, ACCOUNTNAME is the name of your user account in Windows.

## Vault client diagnostic log files

We recommend creating a file and folder to collect diagnostic data for Vault Clients:

1. Make sure that all Autodesk Vault clients are closed (including any Vault Add-ins).
2. Open Windows File Explorer.
3. In the Address bar, type %TEMP% and press the **Enter** key.
4. Create a `.txt` file with the name "ADSKVaultDiagnostics" (the full file name would be `ADSKVaultDiagnostics.txt`).
5. Create a subfolder called ADSKVault (%TEMP%\ADSKVault).
6. Start the Vault Client software.
7. Diagnostic files will be placed in this location.

Important:

* Once the diagnostic information has been collected, copy it to another folder and delete the `ADSKVaultDiagnostics.txt` file. Leaving the file in that location can cause performance issues.

### Reports and Templates Administration

# Reports and Templates Administration

The Vault administrator can create search reports, create and modify report templates, and configure Data Mapping output settings to optimize how collected data is displayed.

Autodesk Report Template Authoring Utility is installed with the Vault Client to help you create simple client report definition files (.rdlc) for storing search data. You can also migrate old reporting template via ReportTemplateAuthoringUtility.exe.

Note: You must open and save the old file in Visual Studio 2015 before migrating it using ReportTemplateAuthoringUtility.exe in vault explorer.

#### Data Mapping Reports

# Data Mapping Reports

The report management feature allows the administrator to assign colors to values in a Data Mapping report template.

Note: The Data Mapping feature is available in the Inventor Vault Add-in for Autodesk Vault Professional.

When the template is used by the Report Generation feature in the CAD application, the colors are automatically assigned to their associated values.

The [Roles and Permissions](GUID-269FDA08-F0C0-47E8-92DA-D832E03F827A.htm) can also remove unused or outdated values from the report template.

When a report is generated that returns a value for which a color has not yet been assigned, the report control will assign a color to the new value from a predetermined list of colors and write back the report template a name and value pair for the new color. The new value and default color assignment are displayed in the Assign Color dialog where the administrator can update the template by assigning a color to this new value.

## The Color Assignment Dialog

When a template is opened in the Assign Color dialog, the chart elements contained in the template are listed along with the currently assigned color for each element. If the template contains more than one chart, the chart elements are grouped by chart.

Templates can be opened from a local folder or from the vault. The Value column will be populated with the names of chart elements only if a report has already been generated. If no report has been generated ,the fields in the Value column are blank.

![](../images/dialog-assign-color.png)

By default, the Assign Color dialog displays a default palette of eight colors. Unless specified in the template, the colors are assigned to chart elements in this order:

* Grey
* Red
* Orange
* Yellow
* Light Green
* Cyan
* Blue
* Violet

Enter the exact chart element name in the Value field and then select a color to assign that color to the chart element.

Save the template to commit the changes.

### Manage Reports

1. Click Tools > Administration > Vault Settings.
2. In the Vault Settings dialog box, select the Behaviors tab.
3. Click Define under Report Management to open the Assign Color dialog.
4. On the File menu, open a report template from either the vault or a local folder.

   Note: If the template is stored in the vault and the administrator has write- permission on the current file, the template is checked out of the vault.

   If the template does not contain any custom color properties, the default color palette is displayed.

   If the custom color properties have already been added to the template, the value names are extracted and displayed with their assigned color on the dialog. Any new values without an assigned color are displayed with the next available color in the default list.
5. Specify a new color assignment for an existing property by selecting a new color in the Color field.

   **OR**

   * Enter the exact value name for a new property in the Value field.
   * Select a color to assign to the property from the Color field.
6. Select File > Save Report Template to commit the changes.

   If the template was checked out of the vault, it is checked back in after being saved.

## Vault Server Administration

# Vault Server Administration

Learn about the Vault Server and managing vaults.

The Vault server stores and maintains the files and metadata that make up the vault. This data is managed by Microsoft SQL Server, a Microsoft relational database. The server software can be installed on a server or workstation that is shared by all users. For a single user, the server can be installed along with the client on a single, isolated workstation.

Three primary components make up the Vault server: a web server, a database, and a file store. The following figure illustrates the basic configuration of the components.

![](../images/single-vault-cap.png)

## Database Server

The database server tracks all the relationships between data. It acts like a library card catalog, containing indexes and pointers of where to find related information. By default, the Autodesk Vault 2021 Data Management Server installs Microsoft® SQL Express Adv 2017. Microsoft SQL Express Adv 2017 can be upgraded any time after the Autodesk Data Management Server components are installed.

See [Vault System Requirements](https://www.autodesk.com/vault-system) and Vault Upgrade information in the Vault Installation help.

## File Store

The file store and the database server work with each other. The database provides the index information for the location of files. The file store is the secure location on the server where the files are located.

Note: Never directly move, delete, or edit a file in the file store. Use the Autodesk Data Management Server console to manage the file store.

## Web Server

Autodesk Data Management Server requires that Windows Internet Information Services (IIS) is installed.

Note: If IIS is not installed on the computer that hosts the server, and you require more than a single-user installation, install IIS before you install Autodesk Vault server.

Note: The original Microsoft Windows installation media might be necessary to complete the IIS installation.

The Autodesk Vault server is actually a Web application that uses services to manage the communication between the clients and the server with Web services. The interaction between the clients and the server resembles the way a web browser communicates with a site on the Internet. The Web services use standard HTTP methods, communicating over the Web server port 80 by default. Microsoft IIS is required for multiple-user configurations.

## Proxy Server

A proxy server forwards requests of client computers to other servers. Some networks force all client computers to use a proxy server for all web service requests.

![](../images/single_vault_cap_proxy%5B.png)

If your network uses a proxy server, you can configure it to use a host name or bypass the proxy server of your host clients.

Note: For more information about configuring a proxy server, see Configure Vault to Use a Proxy Server in the Vault Installation help.

### Autodesk Data Management Server Console

# Autodesk Data Management Server Console

Learn about using the Autodesk Data Management Server (adms) Console for managing your Vault server and vaults.

Perform all database and file store maintenance using the Autodesk Data Management Server console. The console is the interface for the administrator to maintain the vault file stores and databases. Tasks include backing up and restoring data, creating and managing vaults, moving data bases, and purging old data. You can also use the server console to attach, detach, and manage Content Center Libraries for Autodesk Inventor.

The administration utilities in the server console are also available from the [command line](GUID-7FD9DAD8-0104-46FA-BCE7-11259FAB4235.htm). You can use the command line with scripts to create custom schedules and automated maintenance tasks.

The main view summarizes the vaults, sites, and libraries associated with the server.

Log into the server console with a vault account that is assigned the Administrator role. To perform most vault maintenance, you must also have SQL administrator privileges.

**Parent page:** [Vault Server Administration](GUID-ED2DFFB2-EFA8-4A48-816B-37B2C67A6D20.htm)


### Vault Data

# Vault Data

Learn about vaults and vault data.

In Microsoft SQL Server, the data and transaction log files of a vault can be detached, and then reattached to another server, or to a different location on the same server. Detaching a vault removes it from SQL Server and from the vault master database, but leaves it intact within the data and transaction log files that compose the vault. These data and transaction log files can be used to attach the vault to any instance of SQL Server, including the server from which the vault was detached. This makes the vault available in exactly the same state it was in when it was detached.

Detaching and attaching vaults is useful if you want to move a vault to a different physical disk. For example, the disk containing the vault file ran out of disk space, and you want to expand the existing file rather than add a new file to the vault on the other disk.

When you attach a vault, you must specify the name and physical location of the primary data file as well as the SQL log file. The primary file contains the information needed to find the other files comprising the vault unless one or more of those files have changed location since the vault was detached. Any files that have changed location must be specified in addition to the primary file. Otherwise, the SQL Server tries to attach the files based on incorrect file location information stored in the primary file, and the vault is not successfully attached.

**Warning:** The vault server consists of two vaults by default: KnowledgeVaultMaster and Vault plus an additional vault for each new vault created. If you are moving to a new server you must move both vaults to capture all the required information for the vault server. If you are only moving locations on the same server, you do not need to change the vault master location.

The most effective way to move a vault from one computer to another is to backup the vault on the original computer and then restore the vault on the new computer. This ensures that all data is maintained.

Note: For more information on configuring the Autodesk Data Management Server, see the advanced configuration guide available in the online Vault knowledge base.

#### Server Maintenance Part 1: Back Up Your Vault

# Server Maintenance Part 1: Back Up Your Vault

Backing up vault data is essential. Autodesk recommends that you back up your Vault using the following methods.

## Back Up Your Vault

Use the supplied backup-restore utility to back up your Vault data.

Use the server console to back up all data necessary to restore a server if a failure occurs. When you back up the server, all users are blocked from accessing the system. In addition, server console backs up or restores all vaults on the server. There is no way to select individual vaults to back up or restore.

## Develop a Backup Schedule

The next step is to automate the process. Two common methods are:

* Use the Windows Task Scheduler. This process uses the backup tools included with the server console as part of a standard Windows batch file.
* Include the backup as part of a tape backup set. This process uses a tape back up system to back up the vault directly or to use a method like the Windows Task Scheduler.

With the server console command line options, you can create a script to automate the backup process. The following script is intended for a default Autodesk Vault server installation. Edit the backup paths and installation paths as needed.

The preferred and most reliable method for backing up a vault is to integrate the server console backup tools into your tape backup plan.

Note: The following script is for performing full backups ONLY. For more command line options or to create a script for performing incremental backups, see the data management server console Help.

## Automate Backup Using Microsoft Windows Task Scheduler

1. Create a text file called Backup.txt.
2. Insert the following text:

   @ECHO OFFREM DELETE B AND CASCADE A BACKUP SUBDIRECTORIESRMDIR /Q /S "C:\Backup\Vault\B"REN "C:\Backup\Vault\A" "B"REM CREATE A NEW DIRECTORY FOR THE BACKUPMKDIR "C:\Backup\Vault\A\"REM START THE BACKUP PROCESS (this is one line of text)"C:\Program Files\Autodesk\Vault Server 20xx\ADMS Console\Connectivity.ADMSConsole.exe" -Obackup -B"C:\Backup\Vault\A" -VUadministrator -VP[YourPassword] -S
3. Change the name of the text file to Backup.bat to convert it to a batch file.

Note: When backing up a multi-site environment, back up locally on the primary server.

## Create Tape Backups

There are different ways to use a tape backup system to back up a vault. We recommend integrating the Server Console backup tools into your tape backup plan. Many systems allow you to run a script before and after the tape job executes. To back up a vault using a tape backup system, use the following scripts before and after the job runs.

Note: We do not recommend using backup software to back up the SQL database and file store directly. This method increases the difficulty of migrating to a new release of Autodesk Vault server or restoring a vault on a new machine. In addition, never back up the SQL Server using the "live" backup plug-ins that are available for major tape backup systems. Ensure the file store and SQL data are perfectly in sync with each other. Failure to do so can render your data unusable.

1. Run the following script before your tape backup job starts: @ECHO OFF
2. REM THIS WILL STOP THE WEB SERVER AND "CYCLE" THE SQL SERVER REM PROVIDING THE BEST RESULTS FOR BACKING UP THE VAULTIISRESET /STOPNET STOP MSSQL$AUTODESKVAULTNET START MSSQL$AUTODESKVAULTREM START THE BACKUP PROCESS (this is one line of text)"C:\Program Files\Autodesk\Data Management Server 2009\ADMS Console\Connectivity.ADMSConsole.exe" -o backup -B"C:\Backup\Vault\A" -VUadministrator -VP -S
3. Run the following script after your tape backup job completes: @ECHO OFFREM DELETE THE BACKUP SET AFTER THE TAPE SET COMPLETESRMDIR /Q/S C:\Backup\Vault\A"REM START THE WEB SERVERIISRESET /START
4. Validate the Tape Backup To ensure that your backup set restores properly, test both the backup and the backup procedures. We recommend that you install the Autodesk Vault server on a separate computer. Test a full restore of the data using the Restore command in Autodesk Vault server console.

#### Server Maintenance Part 2: Restore Vault Data

# Server Maintenance Part 2: Restore Vault Data

Restore Vault data from a backup.

1. In the Autodesk Data Management Console, click Tools ► Restore.
2. Restoring a vault deletes the current data sets and file store. This action cannot be undone. You are prompted for confirmation before proceeding. Click Yes.
3. Specify whether to restore a directory or a file.
4. In the Select backup directory for restore field, specify the location of the backed up data. To browse for a location, click ... and locate a directory using the file browser.
5. Select whether to restore the database to the original location or to a different location. If you choose Select Restore Location, specify a target directory for the database. This selection is sometimes necessary when restoring data to a different machine that does not have the same drive letters or locations available.
6. Select whether to restore the file to the original location or to a different location. If you choose Select Restore Location, specify a target directory for the file store.
7. Click OK.

   The vault data is automatically migrated when it is restored using Autodesk Vault server console. If you restore the data using the command line, migrate the data after it is restored.

#### Server Maintenance Part 3: Re-index the Server

# Server Maintenance Part 3: Re-index the Server

Re-indexing the server extracts the properties from all the files in the vault. Typically, this indexing process occurs when a file is first added to the vault or when an updated version is checked in.

From time to time, re index the entire vault to:

* Add new properties to the vault that were previously unknown to the system.
* Remove unwanted properties from the vault that are no longer needed, in turn saving space in the SQL Sever database.

The Autodesk Vault server utilizes a technology created by Microsoft called iFilters. iFilters are small applications that exist on the server containing a set of instructions on how to open and extract property data from files. A few iFilters are installed with Autodesk Vault server by default and other exist with the operating system. There are also many third-party iFilters available for other file formats. An Internet search for iFilter returns some of the filters that other software developers have published.

The iFilters that are included by default index the following file types:

* AutoCAD® .dwg
* Autodesk Inventor®
* Autodesk® 3D Studio Max®
* Microsoft® Office

#### Server Maintenance Part 4: Full Content Indexing

# Server Maintenance Part 4: Full Content Indexing

Full content indexing provides the means to index the actual file contents of many different document types.

For example, reading simple text on a .dwg file or finding all occurrences of a word in Microsoft Word documents.

By default, full content indexing is not enabled. Full content indexing can be enabled for each vault on the Autodesk Vault server.

Note: See [Enable Content Indexing](GUID-0CEE4994-566E-4745-92D9-CB1DA46134D3.htm) for more information.

#### Server Maintenance Part 5: Maintain Content Center Libraries

# Server Maintenance Part 5: Maintain Content Center Libraries

In addition to hosting vaults, Autodesk Vault server hosts Content Center libraries. Use the server console to perform Content Center Library administrator tasks.

A Content Center library is contained within a SQL Server database. The database comprises of a pair of files with the extensions mdf-and-ldf. These files together make one library and need to be maintained together.

The console displays the list of Content Center libraries currently installed on the server. Using the Backup command, you can create a back-up of an existing library on the server. Select a library from the list to manage it.

The following is the list of content which can be installed with the Autodesk Inventor products. In the Select Content Center Libraries window of the Installation Wizard, check boxes are selected for the libraries installed by default.

## Create Libraries

You can create a read-write or read-only Content Center library. You can configured it for use in either a local or Autodesk Inventor project that accesses the Content Center libraries from a central server.

1. In the server console, select the Libraries folder in the navigation pane.
2. Click Actions > Create Library.
3. Enter a name for the new library.
4. Select a library partition from the drop-down list.
5. Enter a name for the library database.
6. Click OK.

## Delete Libraries

Deleting a library detaches the selected library from the database server, and deletes the data files (.mdf-and-.ldf) from the hard disk. All data contained in the library is permanently deleted.

1. In the server console, select a library you want to delete in the navigation pane.
2. Click Actions > Delete Library.
3. Click OK.

## Attach Libraries

Use Attach to make a Content Center library available on the server from a pair of existing .mdf-and-.ldf data files already on the computer.

1. In the server console, select Libraries in the navigation pane.
2. Click Actions > Attach Library.
3. Click the browse button, and locate the .mdf file you want to attach. The .ldf file is automatically attached.
4. In the Attach Library dialog box, click OK.

## Detach Libraries

Detaching a library removes a Content Center library from the list of available libraries in the server console. Detach does not delete its data files (mdf-and-ldf) from the server. The data files can be reattached and made available at a later time using the Attach command. They can also be manually copied to another location to be backed up, or moved to another machine.

1. In the server console, select Libraries in the navigation pane.
2. Click Actions > Detach Library.
3. Click the browse button, and locate the .mdf file you want to detach.
4. Click OK.

## Copy Libraries

Access the server console:

* On the local machine if the Content Center libraries are installed locally.
* On the remote server if the Content Center libraries are being hosted by a remote server.

1. In the navigation pane, expand the Libraries folder.
2. In the Libraries folder, right-click the library to copy and then select Copy.
3. In the Copy Library dialog box, the display name, partition, and database name associated with the library to copy are displayed.
   * Enter a name for the new copy of the library.
   * From the Partition drop-down list, select a partition for the new copy of the library. The partition associates the copied library with a particular release of Autodesk Inventor. Only Inventor users using the corresponding version of Inventor can access the libraries in the matching partition.
   * Enter the database name for the copy of the library.
4. Click OK.

You must be a [Content Center Editor](GUID-269FDA08-F0C0-47E8-92DA-D832E03F827A.htm) to make edits to Content Center libraries in Autodesk Inventor.

You must be a [Content Center Administrator](GUID-269FDA08-F0C0-47E8-92DA-D832E03F827A.htm) to perform Content Center administrative task in the server console.

## Copy Libraries During Migration

If you chose to migrate existing libraries, the Copy Libraries dialog displays. The Copy Libraries dialog lists the custom and standard libraries that require migration. Standard content libraries can be either kept and migrated for use with the new version of the data management server or deleted. Custom content libraries can be kept and migrated for use with the new version of the data management server, deleted, or copied forward for use with a newer version of Autodesk Inventor. By default, all libraries are set to be kept and migrated for use with the new version of the server and custom libraries are set to be copied forward to the latest version of Autodesk Inventor.

Note: The Copy Libraries dialog box is only available during the initial migration immediately following an upgrade installation.

1. To delete either a standard library or a custom library, turn off all of the check boxes for the corresponding library. If all check boxes for a library are turned off, the library is deleted during migration.
2. To copy a custom library forward to a new version of Autodesk Inventor, turn on the check box for the library corresponding to the new version of Inventor.

   * If the current version of the custom library is also checked, the existing library is both migrated for use with the new version of the server, and copied forward for use with the new version of Autodesk Inventor. Choosing to keep the original library and copy the library forward requires additional disk space. The amount of disk space required and the amount of disk space available is displayed in the dialog box.
   * If the current version of the current library is turned off, the existing library will be copied forward for use with the new version of Autodesk Inventor and then the original library is deleted.

     Note: To return the dialog to the default settings, click Reset.
3. Click OK. A summary of the migration operations to be performed is presented. If the summary matches your expectations, click Yes to proceed with library migration or click No to return to the Copy Libraries dialog box and change the migration settings.

## Export Libraries

Export copies a set of library files (.mdf-and-.ldf) that are in the server console to a specified location. You can specify a folder on the same machine, or a location available on the network.

1. In the server console navigation pane, select a library you want to export.
2. Click Actions > Export Library.
3. In the Browse for Folder dialog box, specify the location you want to export the .mdf file to, and click OK.

## Import Libraries

Import copies library files (a pair of mdf-and-ldf files) into the standard SQL Server data files directory. Then it performs an attach operation to register them with SQL Server and make them available as a Content Center Library. For example, use Import to copy library files from a third party supplier to the Content Center Library you are administrating.

1. In the server console navigation pane, select a library you want to import.
2. Click Actions > Import Library.
3. In the Browse for Folder dialog box, locate the .mdf file you want to export, and click OK.

## Display Library Summary

Highlight a library to display high-level information about the library and its data files in the main pane.

## Control Library Status

To turn the status of a library to Read-Only or Read-Write, right-click a library in the browser and select Read-Only. You cannot change the status of a default read-only libraries installed with Autodesk Inventor.

## Grant Content Center Permissions

If you require editing permissions for one or more Content Center libraries, you must have a Content Center Editor account set up for you in the data management server console.

Accounts are not required if you use only read-only access to the Content Center library.

Create Content Center library user accounts in the data management server console:

1. In server console, click Tools > Administration.
2. In the Administration dialog box, click Users.
3. In the User Administration dialog box, click New users.
4. In the New User dialog box, enter the desired information for the user. Click the Roles button to assign the user a Content Center role.
5. Select Content Center Editor to assign editing permissions.
6. Click Vaults to assign the user to a vault. Assign a user to a vault, even if you are not using Autodesk Vault Client. This assignment is required to log into the Autodesk Vault server in Autodesk Inventor to access the Content Center libraries.
7. If necessary, click Groups to assign the user to a group (optional).
8. Click OK.
9. In the User Management dialog box, and then in the Administration dialog box, click Close.
10. Communicate user account information and the Login procedure to each member in the team.

## Add New Properties

When a new iFilter is installed, the vault database must be re indexed to recognize the related properties. After, run the Re-Index command to extract the new property data from all the files in the vault, including the historical versions.

Note: Some iFilters create actual properties that are searchable and can be displayed as columns in the vault.

#### Server Maintenance Part 6: Create SQL Maintenance Plan

# Server Maintenance Part 6: Create SQL Maintenance Plan

Maintenance plans can be used to schedule tasks required to make sure that the database performs well, such as keeping database and transaction log file sizes small and checking the database for inconsistencies.

Autodesk recommends that the plan be run at least once per week, during out of office hours.

In a Connected Workgroup Environment, this should be configured on each SQL Server.

Part of the Administrators tasks should be to regularly check that the plan ran successfully.

If the plan was configured for an earlier release of Vault Server, ensure that you check and update the plan in accordance with this article.

The following steps are universal across all versions of SQL in use with Vault Server (Express and Full SQL). The complete list of supported database engines is located in the product readme file.

Note: Please note that if you are running SQL Express and do not have the SQL Management Studio installed, the following steps can be completed through the command prompt through scripts under the section “Creating a Maintenance Script for Microsoft SQL Express,” or you can install the SQL Management Studio for Express, available from Microsoft‟s web site.

1. Login to the SQL Management Studio.
2. Expand Databases, expand System Databases.
3. Right Click on tempdb and select properties.
4. Select the Files page.
5. If using a multi-core system, additional data files should be configured, using the guidelines below. If using a single-core system, skip to step d below.

   1. Data files should equal the number of Logical\Virtual processors available. For example, if the machine has 12 Logical Processors, there would be 1x .mdf file and 11x .ndf files. If disk space is important, "Size" of 512MB can be used instead of 1024MB.

      **Note:** In case of SQL 2016 or later, Data file will default to the lower value of 8 or number of logical cores as detected by setup. The value can be increased as required for a specific workload. The file names for secondary data files will follow the tempdb\_mssql\_#.ndf naming convention where # represents the file ordinal for each additional file.
   2. Click the Add button to add additional data files.
   3. Name the new file(s) temp2, temp3, … as needed.
   4. Set the size of each data file to 1,024 MB. If using a total of 8 datafiles, size of 512 MB can be used.
   5. Set Autogrowth to 100 MB, unrestricted growth for each data file.
   6. Set the LDF log file to combined data file total (example; if there are 2 data files total, the resulting LDF should be set to size of 2048 MB)

      ![](../images/DatabaseProperties_tempdb_2024.png)
6. For users database, KMV, and other Vault databases, set the Compatibility level to SQL Server 2012 (110) under the Options page. The system databases are not defined by Autodesk, and it is safe to leave them at the default compatibility level.
7. Select OK.

## Create a SQL Maintenance Plan for Full SQL

Maintenance plans can be used to schedule tasks required to make sure that the database performs well, such as keeping database and transaction log file size small and checking the database for inconsistencies.

Note: These settings are recommended by Autodesk and should be configured automatically for new installations. If migrated from an earlier release of Vault Server, these settings are not enforced as they may have been changed intentionally by the Administrator.

SQL Standard/Enterprise

1. Verify that the vaults have been backed up with the Autodesk Vault Server Console before proceeding.
2. Make sure that all users are logged out of the vault server.
3. From the Control Panel, double-click Administrative Tools and then double-click the Services icon.
4. Locate the SQL Server Agent (AUTODESKVAULT) service.
5. Right-click on the SQL Server Agent (AUTODESKVAULT) and select Properties.
6. Change the Startup Type to Automatic and start the service.

   ![](../images/SQLServerAgent_Properties_2024.png)
7. Open the Microsoft SQL Management Studio and connect to the AutodeskVault instance. Use \AUTODESKVAULT as the server name and press Connect.
8. Right-click on the Vault database and select properties.
9. On the Files page set:

   * the Autogrowth value for all  databases to by 100MB, unrestricted growth
   * the Size value of all \_log files to 500MB
   * the Autogrowth value for an  files to 25MB
   * the Autogrowth values for all \_log files to By 10 percent, unrestricted growth

   Or, in table form:

   | Logical Name | Size (MB) | Autogrowth |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | KnowledgeVaultMaster |  | By 10MB, unrestricted growth |
   | KnowledgeVaultMaster\_log |  | By 10 percent, unrestricted growth |
   | <Vault> |  | By 100MB, unrestricted growth |
   | <Vault>\_log | 500 | By 10 percent, unrestricted growth |
   | <Custom\_Library> |  | By 25 MB, unrestricted growth |
   | <Custom\_Library>\_log |  | By 10 percent, unrestricted growth |
   | <Standard\_Library> |  | By 25 MB, unrestricted growth |
   | <Standard\_Library>\_log |  | By 10 percent, unrestricted growth |

```
Note: A blank cell in the above table indicates that the default setting should not be changed.

Grey cells, indicate default values and should be set to the above if they are different.

![](../../images/DatabaseProperties_KVM_2024.png)
```

10. On the Options page, set the Compatibility Level to SQL Server 2012 (110) and change the Auto Shrink drop-down list to False.
11. Perform these same steps for all of the KnowledgeVaultMaster, Vault, and Library Vault databases (steps 8 – 10).
12. Expand the Management folder and select the Maintenance Plan folder.
13. Right-click on the Maintenance Plan folder and select Maintenance Plan Wizard. Click Next.

    ![](../images/MaintenancPlanWizard_step1.png)
14. In the Select Plan Properties dialog, enter Vault Maintenance Plan for the name and then click on the Change button to set the schedule.

    ![](../images/MaintenancPlanWizard_step2.png)
15. In the Job Schedule Properties dialog, set the plan to run after an Autodesk Vault Server Console backup has completed. Depending on the size of your dataset, this schedule may have to be run on a different day and time of the week. You may want to run this task on a Saturday to determine the amount of time it will take to complete and then decide the best day and time to run this job on a regular basis.
16. In the Select Maintenance Task dialog, check the following options:

    ![](../images/SelectMaintenanceTask_2024.png)
17. In the Select Maintenance Task Order dialog, set the order to the following:

    ![](../images/SelectMaintenanceTask_postselection_2024.png)
18. In the Define Database Check Integrity Task dialog, select All user databases from the databases drop-down list and check the box next to "Include indexes" and "Physical Only".

    ![](../images/DefineDatabaseCheckIntegrityTask_2024.png)
19. In the Define Rebuild Index Task dialog, select All user databases from the Databases drop-down list.

    ![](../images/DefineRebuildIndexTask_2024.png)
20. In the Define Update Statistics Task dialog, select the following options:

    ![](../images/DefineUpdateStatisticsTask_2024.png)
21. In the Define Cleanup History Task dialog, select cleanup options as needed.

    ![](../images/DefineCleanupHistoryTask_2024.png)
22. In the Select Report Options dialog, specify the location for the maintenance reports.
23. Click Next and then Finish.

## Create a Maintenance Script for Microsoft SQL Express

Microsoft SQL Express does not allow you to create a maintenance plan inside of SQL Server Management Studio Express.

Make sure that the OS (Windows) user that is running the SQL maintenance plan has the sysadmin role inside of SQL.

Tempdb Modifications through the Command Prompt

As noted earlier in this section, if the SQL Server Management Studio is not installed, the tempdb database changes can be completed through the command prompt by performing the following:

1. Open the Command Prompt as Administrator.
2. Copy and Paste each line below into the command prompt and press Enter.

   ```
   SQLCMD -E -S".\AutodeskVault" -Q "ALTER DATABASE [tempdb] SET COMPATIBILITY_LEVEL = 110"
   ```

   ```
   SQLCMD -E -S ".\AutodeskVault" -Q "ALTER DATABASE [tempdb] MODIFY FILE ( NAME = 
   N'tempdev', SIZE = 1024MB, FILEGROWTH = 100MB)"
   ```

   ```
   SQLCMD -E -S ".\AutodeskVault" -Q "ALTER DATABASE [tempdb] MODIFY FILE ( NAME = 
   N'templog', SIZE = 1024MB )"
   ```
3. If using a multi-core system, additional data files should be configured using the guidelines below. \*\*Note The file system path used under FILENAME = should be the same location as the SQL data directory. In the example below, it is 'C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL15.AUTODESKVAULT\MSSQL\DATA. You will want to modify the script to list your correct path.

   1. Data files should equal the number of Logical\Virtual processors available. For example, if the machine has 12 Logical Processors, there would be 1x .mdf file and 11x .ndf files. If disk space is important, "Size" of 512MB can be used instead of 1024MB.

      **Note:** In case of SQL 2016 or later, Data file will default to the lower value of 8 or number of logical cores as detected by setup. The value can be increased as required for a specific workload. The file names for secondary data files will follow the tempdb\_mssql\_#.ndf naming convention where # represents the file ordinal for each additional file.

      ```
      SQLCMD -E -S ".\AutodeskVault" -Q " ALTER DATABASE [tempdb] ADD FILE ( NAME = 
      N'tempdev_2', FILENAME = N'C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL 
      Server\MSSQL15.AUTODESKVAULT\MSSQL\DATA\tempdev_2.ndf', SIZE = 1024MB, 
      FILEGROWTH = 100MB)"
      ```
   2. If additional data files need to be created, simply modify the above example to reflect tempdev\_3, etc, for both NAME and FILENAME.
   3. Set the LDF log file to combined data file total. (example; if there are 2 data files total, the resulting LDF should be set to a size of 2048 MB).

      ```
      SQLCMD -E -S ".\AutodeskVault" -Q "ALTER DATABASE [tempdb] MODIFY FILE ( 
      NAME = N'templog', SIZE = 2048MB )"
      ```

Maintenance Plan

Copy the script below and paste it into a new file saved as VaultMaintenance.bat.

The following is an example of how to run the batch file from the root of C:\ against a database named Vault and output the results to a text file.

```
C:\VaultMaintenance.bat Vault > results.txt
```

Note: A direct copy-paste from this document will require the line breaks be repaired. Also note that the user executing the maintenance plan will need to have permissions to do so inside of SQL. This can be accomplished during the installation of SQL or after.

```
REM This begins the maintenance plan.

### Back Up or Restore a Vault

# Back Up or Restore a Vault

The server console automates the backup and restore process by locating the databases and file store for all vaults, including the master vault, and backing them up to a specified location. It also returns archived files to their correct locations. This process is called the Back Up and Restore Wizard.

Back Up Statistics

The data management server summary displayed in the main pane summarizes server statistics including:

* The number of days since the last incremental backup.
* The number of incremental backups performed since the last full backup.
* Whether the server is currently eligible for an incremental restore.

This section of the summary is grayed out if Incremental Backup and Restore is disabled because administrative operations or other events have occurred that require a full backup. Incremental Backup and Restore is enabled by default.

Creating incremental backups at different sites in a multi-site environment may prevent data from being restored. As a best practice, perform all back up and restore operations at a single site in a multi-site environment.

Rules for Creating a Backup in a Multi-Site Environment

* Before you create a backup, enable all vaults at a site.
* Before you create a backup, replicate the data. If any of the vaults are not replicated, you are prompted to either continue with the backup or cancel the backup operation. If you choose to continue, the data is synchronized automatically during the back up process; however, this extends the time required to back up the data, and other sites cannot access the database for the duration of the back up process.
* As a best practice, perform all backup and restore operations at a single site in a multi-site environment.
* For best performance, create the backup on a server that is in close network proximity to the SQL database.
* Perform all backup and restore operations from the main Vault server (adms) site. See [Start the Back Up and Restore Wizard](GUID-44C82BF0-6F88-46FC-A104-75F4BDF22EA5.htm).
* For an AVFS site, 3rd party software can be used to back up the file store location incase all files are not replicated back to the main Vault server before the backup is executed.

Rules for Restoring a Backup in a Multi-Site Environment

* As a best practice, perform all backup and restore operations at a single site in a multi-site environment.
* All existing data, both the database and the file store, are overwritten when a backup is restored on a site. Any remote file stores are abandoned once data is restored on a site. The vault administrator must either clean up or remove the old, unused file stores.
* If the site at which the data is being restored is not configured for a multi-site environment, the site list will be empty once the data is restored.
* If the site at which the data is being restored is configured for a multi-site environment, the site list is restored as well; however, all vaults on remote sites are disabled. The vaults for the current site are enabled. The vaults at the remote sites must be enabled by the administrator at the remote sites.
* To restore the main Vault server site, follow the steps in the Restore section in [Back Up or Restore a Vault](GUID-FAEEA4AC-D642-4136-9EB0-1058EA3F5DC3.htm).
* To restore an AVFS site in this environment, remove the AVFS site from the Vault console on the main site (adms), rebuild the AVFS site and connect it to the main Vault site using the steps in [Basic File Server Configuration Settings](GUID-953E9F91-0C51-4CBA-B6B5-67255ECEEDDF.htm).

  Note: If the AVFS file store was backed up using a 3rd party software, restore the file store and point to that location while enabling a Vault.

Rules for Creating a Backup in a Connected Workgroup Environment

* All backups in a Connected Workgroup environment is performed from a Vault server (adms) in the publisher workgroup.

  Note: Subscriber workgroups cannot be backed up with a Vault server (adms) connected to the subscriber workgroup.
* Use the Backup and Restore Vault with 3rd party tools to back up a publisher or subscriber workgroup.

Rules for Restoring a Backup in a Connected Workgroup Environment

* If it becomes necessary to restore a subscriber, remove that subscriber from the connected workgroup environment, rebuild the subscriber server, and add it back to the connected workgroup environment.
* Use the Backup and Restore Vault with 3rd party tools to restore a publisher or subscriber workgroup.

Rules for Restoring a Backup with Remote SQL

* On the remote SQL Server, create a local Windows user account with the same credentials as the impersonation user account on the Vault server.
* Restore Vault backup using the steps in the Restore section in [Back Up or Restore a Vault](GUID-FAEEA4AC-D642-4136-9EB0-1058EA3F5DC3.htm).

#### Step 1: Start the Back Up and Restore Wizard

# Step 1: Start the Back Up and Restore Wizard

Use the Back Up and Restore Wizard to manage your Vault data backups.

1. Launch the Autodesk Data Management Server Console.
2. Select Tools > Backup and Restore.
3. In the Backup and Restore Wizard dialog box, select Backup or Restore.
4. Click [Next](GUID-FAEEA4AC-D642-4136-9EB0-1058EA3F5DC3.htm).

**Parent page:** [Back Up or Restore a Vault](GUID-B9EDA55D-EEC3-4CA4-B8C3-F5C6F0B72290.htm)


#### Step 2: Back Up or Restore a Vault

# Step 2: Back Up or Restore a Vault

The second screen of the Back Up and Restore Wizard lets you continue with the Back Up or Restore process you elected in the previous step .

## If Backing Up a Vault

If you chose Back Up on the Startup Screen for the Back Up and Restore Wizard, you are taken to a screen that lets you determine the location for the backed up data. If you are running Autodesk Vault Professional, you can also select whether to perform a full or incremental backup.

1. Note: A log file named Backup History.txt is created for both full and incremental backup operations. The file contains a chronological list of all backups created since the last full backup. This log file is included in the directory containing the backup.
2. Select either Full Backup or Incremental Backup. If a full backup has not yet been performed, Incremental Backup is not available.

   Note: Incremental Backup and Restore is available in Autodesk Vault Professional.

   **Full Backup** backs up all data in the file store and database for the selected vault. Perform a full backup:

   * Before you perform an incremental backup for the first time
   * If a vault or library has been added to or removed from the Autodesk Data Management Server
   * If no changes have occurred

   **Incremental Backup** backs up only new or modified files in the file store as well as any changes to user accounts. Files and libraries that have not changed are not included in an incremental backup. Because standard libraries do not change, they are also not included in incremental backup.

   Following an upgrade to the Autodesk Data Management Server, an incremental backup cannot be performed until a full backup is performed again.
3. Specify the location to store the backed up data. To browse for a location, click **...** and then locate a directory using the file browser. An incremental backup folder is named using the same naming convention as full backups, with the addition of \_INCxx, where xx indicates the increment number.

   Note: The destination folder for an incremental backup does not need to be the same as the folder containing the full backup.
4. Select vaults and libraries to be backed up. To select vaults or libraries, click **…** and then select the vaults and libraries for backup. You can use Select/Unselect all checkbox to quickly select or unselect all vaults and libraries for backup.

   Note: This option is available in Vault Professional and for Full Backup selection only.
5. Turn on the "Validate file stores" check box to validate all the files recorded in the database against the files in the file store. The validation uses a checksum of the files to check that they are identical to the file when checked in to Vault.

   Note: The Validate file stores check box is selected by default. The option to skip file store validation is only available in Autodesk Vault Professional.
6. Turn on the "Validate the backed up files" check box to verify the archive is good once it is created.
7. By default standard Content Center libraries are included in the backup process. To exclude standard Content Center libraries from the back up, turn off the "Backup Standard Content Center Libraries" check box.
8. Turn on the "Backup databases" check box to exclude the backup of any files.

   Note: This option is available in Vault Professional and for Full Backup selection only.
9. By default a backup will wait until all files that need to be replicated are replicated before starting. Turn on the "Ignore non-replicated files" check box to start the backup without waiting for these files to replicate.

   Note: This option is disabled if the Backup databases only check box is selected.
10. Click Finish.

Note: If "Backup databases" options is checked, or not all Vaults and Libraries are selected, then the full backup can't be a base for incremental backup since it's incomplete.

## If Restoring a Vault

If you chose to Restore on the Startup Screen for the Back Up and Restore Wizard, you are taken to a screen that lets you determine which saved Vault data you want to restore. If you are running Autodesk Vault Professional, you can also select whether to perform a full or incremental restore.

Note: A backup created on an Autodesk Data Management Server that has Incremental Backup and Restore cannot be restored on an Autodesk Data Management Server that does not have Incremental Backup and Restore.

Note: Access to the vault database is blocked during this task. Data management clients cannot access the database until the task is complete.

1. Select either Full Restore or Incremental Restore.

   Note: A full restore overwrites all of the data sets and file store for the selected vault.
2. Select a backup directory to restore data sets and file stores.

   Note: Incremental backups can only be restored in chronological order. An older incremental backup cannot be restored once a newer incremental backup has been restored.
3. If you are performing a full restore, select whether the database is to be restored to the default location or a different location. If you choose Select Restore Location:

   * Specify a target directory for the database.
   * Specify a target directory for the log file.

   Note: This option is not available when performing an incremental restore.
4. If you are performing a full restore, select whether the file store is to be restored to the default location or a different location. If you choose Select Restore Location, specify a target directory for the file store. This option is not available when performing an incremental restore.

   * If you want to use the existing file store files during restore, turn on the "Use existing file store files" check box and ensure you have copied the correct file stores to the destination folder.
   * Turn on the "Validate file store" check box to validate all the files recorded in the database against the files in the file store. Select one of these option:
     + Standard - Validation uses a checksum of the files to check that they are identical to the file when checked in to Vault.
     + Quick - Validation doesn't run a checksum and only checks for the existence of the file at the expected path.

   Note: The Validate file store check box is selected by default. The option to skip file store validation is only available in Autodesk Vault Professional.
5. Click Finish.

The vault data is automatically migrated when it is restored using the server console. If you are restoring the data using the command line, you must migrate the data after it is restored.

#### Step 3: View the Results of the Backup or Restore

# Step 3: View the Results of the Backup or Restore

The last screen in the Backup and Restore Wizard indicates if the operation was successful.

* Click Log File to view the ADMSConsoleLog file in a text editor.
* Click Close to close the Backup and Restore Wizard.

**Parent page:** [Back Up or Restore a Vault](GUID-B9EDA55D-EEC3-4CA4-B8C3-F5C6F0B72290.htm)


#### Incremental Backup and Restore

# Incremental Backup and Restore

Creating incremental backups at different sites in a multi-site environment may prevent data from being restored. As a best practice, perform all backup and restore operations at a single site in a multi-site environment.

Note: Incremental Backup and Restore is available in Autodesk Vault Professional.

The options available on the second screen of the Backup and Restore Wizard depend on whether Backup or Restore was selected on the first screen.

**Tip:** The text file ADMSConsoleLog-yyyymmdd.txt summarizes server events that impact backup and restore operations. The log file indicates whether or not the server is eligible for either backing up or restoring as well as the user and event that cause the change in eligibility.

Incremental Backup backs up only new or modified files in the file store as well as any changes to user accounts. Files and libraries that have not changed are not included in an incremental backup. Because standard libraries do not change, they are also not included in a incremental backup.

Incremental backups can only be restored in chronological order. An older incremental backup cannot be restored once a newer incremental backup has been restored. Specify the location to store the backed up data. To browse for a location, click **...** and then locate a directory using the file browser. An incremental backup folder is named using the same naming convention as full backups, with the addition of \_INCxx, where xx indicates the increment number. The destination folder for an incremental backup does not need to be the same as the folder containing the full backup. See [Back Up or Restore a Vault](GUID-FAEEA4AC-D642-4136-9EB0-1058EA3F5DC3.htm) for more details.

If you choose to restore, you should perform the restore starting with Incremental Backup. As long as all incremental and full backups are under the same top-level folder, the restore process will automatically restore Incremental Backups in reverse order and the Full Backup last. The restore process, which includes restoring incremental backups, should always start from the latest incremental backup in the series but choosing Full Restore option in the Backup and Restore wizard.

Note: If the Vault Server is modified since the last restore, it becomes ineligible for an incremental restore. Here are some examples of modifications that can trigger this condition:

* Applying an update.
* Files are checked in or out.
* Administrative settings are modified.
* Migrating databases.

The data management server uses the Windows Tasks Scheduler to schedule Vault backups based on the schedule configured in Vault.

Perform the following steps to create a scheduled backup.

Start the Backup Configuration Dialog

1. Launch the Autodesk Data Management Server Console.
2. Select Tools > Scheduled Backup.
3. In the Backup Configuration dialog, enter the folder location where you want the backup to be stored.
4. Enter the backup log file location and name with a txt file extension.

   Note: If this field is left blank, a backup log file will not be created.

Set Credentials

1. Select the Use Vault user account or Use Windows Authentication as the credentials that will be used to perform the backup.

   Note: The credentials used must be an account with Vault administrative privileges.
2. If you have customized the SQL sa credentials, you will need to enter the new credentials in the SQL Credentials tab.

Select the Backup Type

The backup configuration dialog gives you the ability to schedule a full and/or incremental backup.

1. In either the Full or Incremental backup tab, select the check box to schedule a backup.
2. Select vaults and libraries to be backed up. To select vaults or libraries, click … and then select the vaults and libraries for backup. You can use Select/Unselect all checkbox to quickly select or unselect all vaults and libraries for backup.

   Note: This option is available in Vault Professional and for Full Backup selection only.
3. Set the Start date and time the backup should run.
4. Turn on the "Backup databases only" check box to exclude the backup of any files.

   Note: This option is available in Vault Professional and for Full Backup selection only.
5. Turn on the "Backup Content Center Libraries" check box to include Content Center libraries in the backup process (full-backup-only).
6. Turn on the "Validate file stores" check box to validate all the files recorded in the database against the files in the file store. The validation uses a checksum of the files to check that they are identical to the file when checked in to Vault.

   Note: The option to skip file store validation is only available in Autodesk Vault Professional.
7. Turn on the "Validate the backed up files" check box to verify the archive is good once it is created.
8. By default a backup will wait until all files that need to be replicated are replicated before starting. Turn on the "Ignore non-replicated files" check box to start the backup without waiting for these files to replicate.

   Note: This option is disabled if the Backup databases only check box is selected.
9. Select the day when the type of backup you are creating should be scheduled.
10. Once you are finished selecting all of the options, select the OK button to create the backup batch file.

The batch file is saved in the <>\Autodesk\ADMS 20XX\ADMS Console directory. The full backup batch file is named VaultFullBackup.bat and the incremental backup is named VaultIncrementalBackup.bat.

The backup is scheduled in the Windows Task Scheduler. If necessary, this is where you can make changes to the task.

#### Manually Restore a File Store

# Manually Restore a File Store

The file store can be manually restored by itself from a backup package to a remote location in a multi-site environment.

This process should only be done by experienced vault administrators.

1. Within the selected backup package, open the folder FileStores. The FileStores folder contains one folder for each vault in the backup. Each folder is named according to the vault to which it belongs.
2. Locate the appropriate file store folder and copy it to the remote location.

#### Resolve a Data Validation Error

# Resolve a Data Validation Error

Before data is backed up or restored, it is checked for integrity.

If a file is missing from the file store or from the backed up data, the Validate Datasets and File Stores dialog displays the following error:

ERROR: File not found in file store for .file namedatabase name

If an entry is missing from the database, the Validate Datasets and File Stores dialog displays the following warning:

Warning: File not found in database for .file namedatabase name

You can click OK to proceed with a back up or restore the data.

## Back Up Data

**Resolve the error by re-adding the file or files missing from the file store.**

1. In the Validate Datasets and File Stores dialog, note the name of the file or files missing from the file store.
2. Locate a local copy of the missing file in a working folder.
3. In Autodesk Vault, search for and delete the files indicated in the Validate Datasets and File Stores dialog.
4. Re-add the file to the vault using the corresponding Vault Add-in for the file type.
5. Return to the server console and rerun the Backup command.

**If either the warning or the error has not been seen on prior back ups, restore the most recent backup.**

* If the missing file or files cannot be located in a working folder or the data is corrupt, restore the most recent back up of the data.

  Note: Restoring data replaces current vault data. Any recent changes to the data is lost. The vault is reset to the state of the previous back up.

## Restore a Backup

1. In the Validate Datasets and File Stores dialog, note the name of the missing file or files, and then click OK to proceed with restoring the data.
2. Locate a local copy of the missing file in a working folder.
3. In Autodesk Vault, delete the file from the file list.
4. Re-add the file to the vault using the corresponding Vault Add-in for the file type.
5. Use the server console to back up the data to avoid having this issue recur.

#### Set Up a Remote Backup Location

# Set Up a Remote Backup Location

If you plan to back up your Vault data to a remote share, you must create a new domain user account, create a remote share, and set the new account in the Autodesk Data Management Server Console.

After these steps are complete, modify the SQL Service to use a domain account using the following steps.

Note: The new domain account created for these steps needs to be added to the default SQL users group for the AutodeskVault instance. The group created by SQL  is called SQLServerMSSQLUser$$AUTODESKVAULT.

1. In the Control Panel, Administrative Tools, double-click the Services icon.
2. Double-click the SQL Server (autodeskvault) service, and select the Log On tab.

   ![](../images/dialog-sql-server-log-on.png)

3. Select the This Account radio button, and enter a domain account in the form of Domain\_Name\Domain\_account (with-the-correct-password).

   Note: If you change the login credentials of the service, you are prompted to restart the MS SQL Server service. Please do so for changes to take effect. In addition, ensure that clients are not using the Autodesk Vault Server before restarting SQL Server.
4. Verify that the account specified has write access on the share to which you are backing up.

#### Back up and Restore Vault with Third-Party Tools

# Back up and Restore Vault with Third-Party Tools

Third-party tools can be used to back up and restore Autodesk Vault. Additionally, the 'days since last backup' counter resets when 'Backup databases only' is selected in the ADMS Console, displaying the last backup date. This integration provides accurate backup history and complements your third-party tools for effective data management.

Refer to [this guide](https://download.autodesk.com/us/vault/backup-and-restore-autodesk-vault.pdf) for an example of backing up and restoring a vault with a third-party solution.

### Manage Vaults and Databases

# Manage Vaults and Databases

Learn about how vaults and databases work.

When you install the Autodesk Vault server, a single vault named Vault is created. The database files for the vault are created in the MSSQL$AUTODESKVAULT\Data folder under the Microsoft SQL Server installation folder.

![](../images/structure-databasefiles-server.png)

Several of the databases located in the Data folder are used by Microsoft SQL Server while others are specific to the vault. Each database file (mdf) has an associated log file (LDF) that contains important transaction data and must be moved, backed up, and restored along with the database file.

* KnowledgeVaultMaster.mdf is the master vault database and it maintains the list of users, user permissions, and a list of vaults and their corresponding file store location.

Note: **Important:** Never modify information in the SQL database.

* Vault.mdf is the database for the vault named Vault. Each vault also has a SQL Server log file associated with it called VaultName.ldf.

![](../images/structure-databasefiles-datadetails.png)

The second component of every vault is the associated file store where the files are stored. The file store is structured as a hierarchy of folders that are located under a main folder that has the same name as the vault. The filestore location for the default vault named Vault is C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Autodesk\VaultServer. Each data file is stored in its own folder in a normal, uncompressed format. The folders for the file store are created when you add the first file to the vault.

**Important:** Never modify the files or folder structure in the file store. Only access these files through the client interface.

#### Master Vault

# Master Vault

Learn about the master vault.

KnowledgeVaultMaster is the master database for the Autodesk data management server. Similar to the SQL master database, KnowledgeVaultMaster is a separate database containing common global administrative and configuration information for all of the vault and library databases on the Autodesk Data Management Server.

The names of the files for the master vault are:

* KnowledgeVaultMaster.mdf
* KnowledgeVaultMaster\_log.LDF

Note: The default location for these files is:

* C:\Program Files \Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL.1\MSSQL\Data

#### Delete a Vault

# Delete a Vault

Deleting a vault permanently destroys the information related to the vault, including the SQL database and the file store.

When a vault is deleted in a multi-site environment, any scheduled replications with the vault are deleted as well. If the vault data had been replicated to other sites, the replicated data remains at the other sites. A dialog box is displayed indicating which other sites contain replicated data.

Note: A vault cannot be deleted if it is currently being replicated.

Access to the vault database is blocked during the delete operation. Data management clients cannot access the database until the operation is complete.

Important: The Delete operation is not reversible. All information related to this vault is permanently removed, including all files associated with it.

When working in a Connected Workgroups (aka-full-replication/database-replication) environment, the Delete operation is limited to the Publisher workgroup.

Delete a Vault

1. Launch the Autodesk Data Management Console.
2. In the navigation pane, select a vault from the Vaults folder.
3. Select Actions > Delete.
4. Click Yes to confirm your actions.

   The vault is deleted and all information related to the vault is permanently removed.

#### Create a Vault

# Create a Vault

Use the server console to create additional vaults.

You can organize your information into different locations by creating different vaults. Vaults are completely independent from each other. A client computer can only be logged on to one vault at a time.

Note: When adding a vault in a multi-site environment, the new vault is disabled for all other sites by default. All other sites must enable the new vault.

1. Launch the Autodesk Data Management Server Console.

   Note: If this is the first time launching the Autodesk Data Management Server Console, you are asked if you want to create a vault. Click yes, log in, and skip to step 3.
2. In the navigation pane, select the Vaults folder.
3. Click Actions > Create.
4. In the Create Vault dialog box, enter the name for the new vault. The name cannot contain special characters or spaces.

   Note: A vault cannot have the same name as an existing library.
5. The file store can be located in a default location, or a new location can be specified. Click OK to create the new vault with the default file store location, or click Select File Store Location to specify a new location, and then click OK.

   Note: The file store is where the vault database stores the actual files that are in the vault server. The location can be local or remote. If you want to specify a location on another computer, use UNC path naming conventions. For example: \\SERVER\SHARE\Vault.
6. If you want to accept the Default Vault configuration, click OK to create the Vault.

   Otherwise, select Use Configuration and choose one of the following configuration templates for your vault:

   * **Building–**Creates a vault with inherent properties for Architectural, Engineering, and Construction (aec) design workflows.

#### Attach and Detach Vaults and Databases

# Attach and Detach Vaults and Databases

Learn about attaching and detaching vaults and databases.

When you install the Autodesk data management server, a single vault named Vault is created. The database files for the vault are created in the MSSQL$AUTODESKVAULT\Data folder under the Microsoft SQL Server installation folder.

Several of the databases located in the Data folder are used by Microsoft SQL Server while others are specific to the vault. Each database file (mdf) has an associated log file (LDF) that contains important transaction data and must be moved, backed up, and restored along with the database file.

KnowledgeVaultMaster.mdf is the master vault database and it maintains the list of users, user permissions, and a list of vaults and their corresponding filestore location.

Note: Detaching a vault and attaching it to a new server installation without also attaching the KnowledgeVaultMaster is not supported and will lose all non-default users and corresponding data. All subsequent attach cases must include the original KnowledgeVaultMaster database.

Note: Important: Never modify information in the SQL database.

Vault.mdf is the database for the vault named Vault. Each vault also has a SQL Server log file associated with it called VaultName.ldf.

The second component of every vault is the associated file store where the files are stored. The file store is structured as a hierarchy of folders that are located under a main folder that has the same name as the vault. The filestore location for the default vault named Vault is C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Autodesk\VaultServer. Each data file is stored in its own folder in a normal, uncompressed format. The folders for the file store are created when you add the first file to the vault.

##### Detach a Vault

# Detach a Vault

Detaching a vault disconnects it from the server so it can be moved to another location.

Before detaching the master vault database, you must detach all other databases. The vault and its log file are detached. The names of the files for a vault named "Vault" are:

* Vault.mdf
* Vault\_log.ldf

These files must exist as a pair and cannot be renamed. The default location for these files is:

* C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL.1\MSSQL\Data

Detaching a vault removes all permissions to the vault. Once the vault is re-attached, permissions for each user and group must be reassigned. In a multi-site environment, the file store path is deleted for all other sites. If the vault is re-attached, the file store path must be reassigned at each site.

1. In the navigation pane, open the Vaults folder and then select a vault to detach.
2. Select Actions > Detach.
3. You are prompted to confirm your actions. Click OK.

The vault and its log file are detached.

After the vault is detached, you can move the two corresponding files. The .mdf and .ldf files must be kept together. Attaching a vault reconnects the set of vault files that have been moved to the database engine.

#### Archive Files and Folders

# Archive Files and Folders

Learn about archiving files or folders.

The archive feature in Autodesk Vault Professional allows administrators to move files and folders to a separate storage location for long-term retention and backup. It provides flexible backup and restoration options for archive file stores. A new **Archive Status** property is introduced for folders and files.

**Enabling Archiving**

Administrators can enable the archiving feature. The enable action opens a dialog that requests for the 'Archived File Store' path. Once enabled, the archive feature cannot be disabled.

**Archiving Files and Folders**

Follow these steps to archive files and folders in Autodesk Vault Professional:

1. In the Vault client, navigate to the files or folders you want to archive.
2. Select one or multiple files or folders.
3. Right-click on the selected items and choose **Archive**.

You can access archive-related commands in the **Edit** menu as well.

* **Archive processing**

  Once archiving is initiated, the "Archive Status" of the files changes to "To Be Archived."
  If the archive command is canceled before execution, the status reverts to "None," and the files remain in the production file store. During the archive server task, files marked "To Be Archived" are moved to the Archive File Store, and their "Archive Status" updates to "Archived."

* **Archiving Folders vs. Files**

  When a folder is archived, its **Archive Status** property is updated, but the properties of its contents remain unchanged. The folder’s contents are archived and moved from the production file store to the archive file store when the archive server task runs.
* **Archiving Design Files**

  When archiving a design file, its associated DWF and SVF files are also archived and removed from the production file store.

**File Archive Status and Behavior**

Files can have an **Archive Status** of "None", "To Be Archived", "Archived", or "Historically Archived", while folders can have a status of "None" or "To Be Archived". The historical file versions track their archive state using the 'Archive Status (Historical)' property for all versions. Note that actions such as category changes, state changes, copy to replace, or revision changes increase the version number but do not create a new physical file. Changes to folder properties do not impact file properties.

When new file versions are created, whether through content edits or property changes, these new versions will remain in the production filestore and will not be automatically archived. Users must manually archive these new versions if they want them stored in the archive filestore.

**Search Behavior**

Advanced search is supported for archive related properties. Properties available for searching includes:
• Archive Status
• Archive Status (Historical)

Note: Archived files and folders are not included in basic search results, including searching by using archive status values such as 'Archived', 'To Be Archived', and 'Historically Archived'.

**Backup, Restore, and Replication Considerations**

The backup process is the same as described in the [Back up or Restore a Vault](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-B9EDA55D-EEC3-4CA4-B8C3-F5C6F0B72290) section, but administrators can choose whether to include the archive file store in backups, along with the production file stores.

The restore process keeps archived files separate from the production file store. If the backup includes the archive file store, it will be restored accordingly. During the restore action, users can specify the location for the archive file store. For more information, see [Back up or Restore a Vault](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-B9EDA55D-EEC3-4CA4-B8C3-F5C6F0B72290).

Enable Archive command is only available in Publisher. The file store replication only replicates production file stores. For more information about replicating files, see [Replication of files and folders](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-10B3BCB8-ECA8-42BE-B775-0DA068F0EAE7).

#### Purge Files in a Vault

# Purge Files in a Vault

Purge file versions in a vault by specifying criteria to determine which files are removed.

You can specify criteria for removing versions from a vault. You specify the conditions that must be met in order for a file version to be kept in the vault. Versions that do not meet the specified criteria are then removed from the vault.

Files are purged based on revision and lifecycle rules. To purge files that are not controlled by a lifecycle, configure the version selection criteria section in the Purge Files dialog.

1. In the ADMS Console, select the vault for which you want to purge file versions.
2. Select **Actions > Purge Files**.
3. In the **Purge Files** dialog, turn on the check box next to each of the selection rules to determine the data to be purged:

   |  |  |
   | --- | --- |
   | **Versions except latest** | Specify how many file versions to leave in the vault. |
   | **Versions older than days** | Specify how old the files to purge should be. |
   | **Exclude versions where comment contains:** | Enter a text string contained within the Comments field of the files in the vault. Any files containing this string will be excluded from the purge process.  Enter an asterisk (\*) in the Comments field. Any file version which has a comment will be excluded from the purge.  Note: This asterisk (\*) workflow is supported only for 'Versions not controlled by Lifecycles.’ |
4. Click **Export Candidates** to generate a pre-report (.csv-file) that shows the list of purge candidates.

   Note: The pre-report includes all file versions that can be purged. However, some candidate file versions can't be purged if some non-purgeable parent files use them.
5. Click **OK** to confirm the purge.

#### Purge Items in a Vault from the Autodesk Data Management Server Console

# Purge Items in a Vault from the Autodesk Data Management Server Console

Purge item versions in a vault based on the item's lifecycle state control settings.

Note: Items are available in Vault Professional.

You can purge items from the ADMS Console or the Autodesk Vault Client.

Note: Purging items from the ADMS Console performs a vault-wide purge, whereas purging items from the Vault Client requires you to select specific items for purge.

When a lifecycle state is created, the administrator must identify which item and file versions in that state are retained during a purge.

For example, a lifecycle state can be defined so that all item versions in the Review State are purged except for the latest version when the Purge command is invoked.

Note: See [Edit Lifecycle State Control Settings](GUID-02294D64-9ACA-4546-956E-095D9D7814B1.htm) for more information.

If an item does not have a lifecycle assignment, the tip version of each item revision is retained and all other item versions are purged.

Purge Items from the Autodesk Data Management Server Console

1. In the ADMS Console, select the vault for which you want to purge item versions.
2. Select Actions > Purge Items.
3. Click OK to confirm the purge.

   All item versions are purged based on their lifecycle control settings.

#### Migrating a Database

# Migrating a Database

Learn about migrating a Vault database.

When you install the Autodesk data management server, a single vault named Vault is created. The database files for the vault are created in the MSSQL$AUTODESKVAULT\Data folder under the Microsoft SQL Server installation folder.

Several of the databases located in the Data folder are used by Microsoft SQL Server while others are specific to the vault. Each database file (mdf) has an associated log file (LDF) that contains important transaction data and must be moved, backed up, and restored along with the database file.

KnowledgeVaultMaster.mdf is the master vault database and it maintains the list of users, user permissions, and a list of vaults and their corresponding filestore location.

Note: Important: Never modify information in the SQL database.

Vault.mdf is the database for the vault named Vault. Each vault also has a SQL Server log file associated with it called VaultName.ldf.

The second component of every vault is the associated file store where the files are stored. The file store is structured as a hierarchy of folders that are located under a main folder that has the same name as the vault. The filestore location for the default vault named Vault is C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Autodesk\VaultServer. Each data file is stored in its own folder in a normal, uncompressed format. The folders for the file store are created when you add the first file to the vault.

Note: Important: Never modify the files or folder structure in the file store. Only access these files through the client interface.

##### Migrate a Database

# Migrate a Database

There are two migration types: automatic and manual.

Automatic Migration

If you have upgraded to a new version of the Autodesk Data Management server and an existing database is discovered, you are prompted to migrate the database for use with the new version of the server the first time you log into the server console. If you choose not to migrate a vault or library database the first time you start the server console, the database is listed in the server console as not migrated.

Note: The Migrate Databases dialog is only available during the initial migration immediately following an upgrade installation. If you select No on this dialog box and later want to migrate databases, follow the instructions under Manual Migration.

1. In the Migrate Databases dialog, chose whether or not to migrate existing vaults and/or existing libraries.
   * In the Vaults section, select Yes to migrate the existing vault database now. Select No to leave the vault database non-migrated.
   * In the Libraries section, select Yes to migrate the Content Center library database. Select No to leave the library database non-migrated. If you choose to migrate libraries, see Copy libraries during migration.
2. Click OK.

Note: Non-migrated vaults and libraries must be migrated to the new version of the server before they can be accessed. Non-migrated databases can be migrated manually at a later time.

Manual Migration

When restoring a vault using the server console, the vault is automatically migrated to the latest version. You can also use the server console command line to restore a vault. If a vault has been restored using the command line but not migrated, it is indicated in the server console using a yellow warning sign.

1. From the navigation pane, select a non-migrated vault.
2. Select Actions > Migrate.
3. When the migration finishes, click OK.

**Tip:** To improve indexing performance, all unnecessary property definitions should be set to "Not In Use" following migration.

**Note:**

* A vault from an Autodesk data management server more than two releases old cannot be directly migrated to the current release. The vault must first be migrated to a supported version and then migrated to the current release.
* An Autodesk Vault Professional vault cannot be migrated for use with Autodesk Vault Basic.

#### Optimize a Database

# Optimize a Database

If the administrative summary for a specific vault indicates that defragmentation is recommended, the database can be defragmented using the server console.

Note: Access to the vault database is blocked during this task. Data management clients cannot access the database until the task is completed.

1. Select a vault from the Vaults folder. The administrative summary for the vault indicates if defragmentation is recommended.
2. Select Actions > Optimize Database. Before performing any defragmentation operation, all the indexes should be analyzed properly.
3. Click Analyze to perform a scan on the database and report the number of fragmentations.
4. Click Optimize to defragment the database. Defragmentation actually rebuilds or reorganizes the indexes to match the logical ordering of data.
5. You are prompted to confirm locking the vault to prevent users from accessing it during the operation. Click Yes.
6. A message is displayed indicating that the defragmentation completed successfully. Click OK.

### File Stores

# File Stores

A Vault Server environment consists of two main components: the database component and the file store component.

The database provides the index information for the location of the files, whereas the file store is the physical location of the stored files. Each new vault the environment has a unique database and file store.

The file store location defaults to C:\ProgramData\Autodesk\VaultServer\FileStore.

Note: Never directly move, delete, or edit a file in the file store. Use the Autodesk Data Management Server console to manage the file store.

Each data file is stored in its own folder in a normal, uncompressed format.

#### Remote File Stores

# Remote File Stores

The Vault file store can be set up on a remote computer.

Using a remote file store requires configuring full permissions and accounts. See [Move the File Store to a Mapped Drive or Remote Share](GUID-61DE28F0-8C59-469F-8AE3-AFE728268EBA.htm) for more information about permissions.

The vault supports two basic file store configurations:

* File store located on the Autodesk Vault Server.

  ![](../images/single-vault-cap.png)
* File store located on a remote file server that has a shared folder.

  ![](../images/illustration-privatecontent.png)

You can use a remote file server to host the file store and/or backup and restore vault data. See [Move the File Store to a Mapped Drive or Remote Share](GUID-61DE28F0-8C59-469F-8AE3-AFE728268EBA.htm) for more information.

### Content Center Libraries

# Content Center Libraries

Learn about using Content Center Libraries in Vault.

Administrative tasks are performed on the computer hosting the Content Center Libraries. Access the server console on the machine hosting the libraries: either on a local Autodesk Inventor installation, or a remote Autodesk data management server.

If the Content Center libraries are installed on a remote server:

* You must be assigned Editor permissions in the server console to perform any of the editing tasks.
* You must log into your vault server to perform any editing tasks in the Content Center Editor dialog box in Autodesk Inventor.
* Access the server console on the remote server to perform administrative tasks.

If the Content Center libraries are installed locally and you are working in a single user environment:

* You automatically have permissions to perform editing tasks
* You are automatically logged into the Autodesk data management server on your local drive
* Access the server console: Start > Programs > Autodesk > Autodesk Data Management > Autodesk Data Management Server Console.

#### Install, Add, and Remove Content Center Libraries

# Install, Add, and Remove Content Center Libraries

Install, add, and remove Content Center Libraries in Vault.

Your installation of Autodesk Inventor comes with the following default content libraries:

* Inventor Standard Content: These contains a variety of standard parts, such as bolts, steel shapes, and bearings.
  + ANSI
  + DIN
  + ISO
  + JIS and GB
  + Other International Standards
* Parker library: Contains Standard Content used by Parker for tube and pipe fittings.

To remove a default (or-user-created) library after installation, you must use the server console.

Note: You can edit and publish only to read/write libraries. The Content Center libraries installed with the data management server libraries are read-only and cannot be edited. The read-only status cannot be changed for the default libraries.

**Content Center Libraries and the Server Console**

The server console manages Content Center libraries. The server console is installed when the Autodesk data management server is installed.

Use the server console to:

1. **Create new read/write or read-only libraries** when you need to modify the Content Center standard parts to meet the requirements of your company's standards. Then use the Copy to command in Autodesk Inventor to copy the read-only library families to a writable library, so that you can modify per your Company's standards.

   Additionally, you can only publish to a read/write library. If you created standard parts for your Company that you want to add to the Content Center, you must use the server console to create a read-only library that you can publish to.
2. **Delete** a library that is not being used by your company from the server.
3. **Detach** a library from the Content Center dialog box and from the Configuration dialog box when you do not want to make a particular library available to users.
4. **Attach** an existing library and make it available within the Configuration dialog box in Autodesk Inventor.
5. **Import** a library from another source and make it available within the Configuration dialog box in Autodesk Inventor.
6. **Export** a library for use elsewhere.
7. **Copy** a library.

You can see the list of libraries on a local machine that are being managed by the server console in the Content Center Libraries Configuration dialog box in Autodesk Inventor.

**An .mdf and an .ldf file comprise one library.** They must be maintained as a pair for both Import and Export.

You must be a [Content Center Editor](GUID-269FDA08-F0C0-47E8-92DA-D832E03F827A.htm) to make edits to Content Center libraries in Autodesk Inventor.

You must be a [Content Center Administrator](GUID-269FDA08-F0C0-47E8-92DA-D832E03F827A.htm) to perform Content Center administrative task in the server console.

**Access the Server Console**

Content Center administrative tasks are performed in the server console.

You must access the server console on the machine hosting your Content Center libraries to perform administrative tasks.

Access the server console:

* On the local machine if the Content Center libraries are installed locally.
* On the remote server if the Content Center libraries are being hosted by a remote server.

**Access:** Start > Programs > Autodesk > Autodesk Data Management > Autodesk Data Management Server Console.

Access the server console:

* On the local machine if the Content Center libraries are installed locally.
* On the remote server if the Content Center libraries are being hosted by a remote server.

**Tip:** The Content Center libraries installed by default are read-only and cannot be modified. Use Create Library to create a new read/write library and then use the Copy to command in Autodesk Inventor to copy read-only library parts into the new read/write library. The new library can then be modified to meet your needs.

You can only publish to a read/write library. If you created standard parts for your company that you want to add to the Content Center, use the server console to create a read/write library that you can publish to.

1. In the navigation pane, right-click the Libraries folder and then select Create Library.
2. In the Create Library dialog box, enter a display name for the new library.
3. From the Partition drop-down list, select a partition for the new library. The partition associates the library with a particular release of Autodesk Inventor. Only Inventor users using the corresponding version of Inventor can access the libraries in the matching partition.
4. Enter a name for the library database .mdf file.
5. Click OK

Note: By default, a new library is read/write. To change the status of a user-created library, right-click the library in the navigation pane, and select Read Only.

#### Copy Libraries During Migration

# Copy Libraries During Migration

If you have chosen to migrate existing libraries, the Copy Libraries dialog is displayed. The Copy Libraries dialog lists the custom and standard libraries that require migration.

Note: The Copy Libraries dialog is only available during the initial migration immediately following an upgrade installation.

* Standard content libraries can be either kept and migrated for use with the new version of the data management server or deleted.
* Custom content libraries can be kept and migrated for use with the new version of the data management server, deleted, or copied forward for use with a newer version of Autodesk Inventor.

By default, all libraries are set to be kept and migrated for use with the new version of the server and custom libraries are set to be copied forward to the latest version of Autodesk Inventor.

**Copy Libraries During Migration**

1. To delete either a standard library or a custom library, turn off all of the check boxes for the corresponding library. If all check boxes for a library are turned off, the library will be deleted during migration.
2. To copy a custom library forward to a new version of Autodesk Inventor, turn on the check box for the library corresponding to the new version of Inventor.

   * If the current version of the custom library is also checked, the existing library will both be migrated for use with the new version of the server and copied forward for use with the new version of Autodesk Inventor. Choosing to keep the original library and copy the library forward requires additional disk space. The amount of disk space required and the amount of disk space available is displayed in the dialog.
   * If the current version of the current library is turned off, the existing library will be copied forward for use with the new version of Autodesk Inventor and then the original library will be deleted.

   Note: To return the dialog to the default settings, click Reset.
3. Click OK. A summary of the migration operations to be performed is presented. If the summary matches your expectations, click Yes to proceed with library migration or click No to return to the Copy Libraries dialog and change the migration settings.

The SQL logs are named sequentially with the most recent (current) file being named errorlog followed by errorlog.1 then errorlog.2 and so on.

## DWG iFilter Log files

There are log files maintained by the various iFilters used when performing some Vault operations like re-index. These log files can be helpful when troubleshooting problems with block attributes or properties not indexing as expected in Vault Client.

Folder location and file name:

Depending on your server setup, your iFilter log files may be contained in a different location. C:\Windows\Temp\ OR %TEMP%

DWGFILT.\*.log

### Indexing Properties

# Indexing Properties

Learn about how properties are indexed in a vault.

When a file is added to a vault, the file and all of its file properties (file-size,-date-created,-and-so-on) are added to the vault. If all the associated properties are defined in the vault, the property values are updated. If the property definition is new to the vault, the vault adds the property definition to the vault before storing the value. Depending on the type of files stored, each vault may have a different collection of properties that it maintains. These properties and values are indexed by the vault for quick retrieval during searches.

#### Re-Indexing Properties

# Re-Indexing Properties

Learn about re-indexing properties in a vault.

Re-indexing scans the selected vault database and extracts and indexes properties from the files in the vault database. The extraction and indexing process uses the latest available iFilters/Content Source Property Providers for the files. Only properties currently set to Enabled and properties that have read-mappings are re-indexed. During re-indexing, existing property (e.g.,-user-defined-property) values are updated.

## Reasons for re-indexing:

* New iFilters or Content Source Property Providers have been added that extract more relevant information.
* Property definitions have been set to Enabled.
* Read-mappings have been modified.

Which Properties Get Indexed

When files are added to a vault, any file properties that are defined as Enabled in the Properties Management dialog in Vault are indexed. The following are some of the property definitions that are automatically created and set to Enabled when Autodesk Data Management Server is installed:

* Author
* Comments
* Keywords
* Thumbnail
* Material
* Part Number
* DWG Creator Name
* DWG Creator Version

Additional property definitions can be created by the administrator.

Note: For more information and complete instructions for managing file properties, see Properties Administration.

## Filters

You can use filters to limit the number of files that are re-indexed. Following is a list filters that can be used to refine the re-indexing process:

* **File Extension–**use to re-index files of a particular type.

  Usage: Input file extensions with or without leading dots. Separate each extension by a comma or a semi-colon (with-or-without-spaces).
* **Provider–** use to re-index files based on the iFilter or Content Source Property Provider.

  Usage: Select provider(s) from the pre-defined list of providers.
* **Date–** use to re-index files that are checked in within a specified time period.

  Usage: Select the start and end dates to define the date range. The reindexing process will only index files that were checked in during this time frame.

Note: All three filters can be used in combination with each other. Use the OR operator between File Extension and Provider filters. Use AND between Date and other filters.

## Indexing and Server Performance

The re-indexing process is assigned "Below Normal" priority on the server, allowing users to continue accessing the Autodesk Data Management Server even while files are being re-indexed. If the vault is backed up during the re-indexing process, the re-indexing is paused for the duration of the backup and then automatically restarted once the backup has finished. If a vault is being re-indexed and the same vault is restored, the re-indexing operation stops and all properties re-indexed to that point are replaced by the properties from the restored version.

Note: To run the re-indexing process at a higher priority on the server, use the [command line](GUID-7FD9DAD8-0104-46FA-BCE7-11259FAB4235.htm). While running the re-indexing process as a high priority is faster, the priority cannot be changed once the process begins.

When migrating a vault, all property definitions that are set to Enabled remain Enabled. Once migrated, the administrator can disable those property definitions which are no longer needed. Any new property definition added to the vault following migration is set to Enabled by default. Re-indexing processes files from newest to oldest. In the event that the server is suddenly re-booted or loses power, re-indexing automatically starts on the last file processed when the server is brought back on line.

When re-indexing properties in a replicated environment, the re-index operation processes files located on the server from which it was started.

#### Re-index File Properties in a Vault

# Re-index File Properties in a Vault

Depending on your Vault release, you can specify whether just the latest or released versions, or all versions of a file are included in the re-index.

1. From the ADMS Console, select a vault from the Vaults folder.
2. Select Actions > Re-index File Properties.
3. Select the types of files that you want to re-index.

   * **Re-index latest versions only**

     The latest versions are reindexed.
   * **Re-index latest and released versions only**

     The latest versions, released versions, and pending released versions are re-indexed.

     This is the default option.
   * **Re-Index all files**

     Re-indexes all of the files in the vault.
4. Specify filters for re-indexing. You can filter files based on file extension, provider, or date.
5. Click Calculate to see the number of files that will be re-indexed based on the selection set.
6. Click OK.
7. Click Yes on the prompt to begin re-indexing file properties.

   Clients can access the vault while it is being re-indexed. Not all properties may be up-to-date until the re-indexing has finished.

**Parent page:** [Indexing Properties](GUID-18ECEB1E-C617-4469-A631-D397F827E0BA.htm)


#### Force a Re-Index

# Force a Re-Index

Vault maintains re-index status for every file. So even though certain criteria are selected for a re-index operation, it is not necessary that all files that fall under the criteria be re-indexed because some files may be up-to-date thus not needing a re-index. However, the Administrator may choose to force a re-index on all files that meet the selected criteria by selecting the Force Re-Index option that can be exposed by expanding the dialog.

Force Re-Index is especially useful when a new iFilter is added, and also after migration. Apart from that there is really no need to run a Force Re-Index.

Note: Re-Index operation can take longer to complete when Force Re-Index is selected, so, use this option only when it is absolutely needed.

Note: The selection on the Re-Index dialog is per vault. The selection persists for the next session for that vault except for the Force Re-Index option, which is unchecked every time the dialog opens.

* To force a re-index, click the expand button ![](../images/icon-getcheckout-expanded.png) and select the Force Re-Index check box.

**Parent page:** [Indexing Properties](GUID-18ECEB1E-C617-4469-A631-D397F827E0BA.htm)


#### Check the File Property Re-indexing Status

# Check the File Property Re-indexing Status

Once the re-indexing operation has been initiated for a vault, you can check the progress using the Re-Index File Properties Status dialog.

The Re-Index File Properties Status dialog indicates which vault is being re-indexed, what percent of the files have been re-indexed, as well as the total number of files that have been re-indexed and the number of files remaining. The re-indexing can also be stopped using the status dialog.

The Re-Index Status dialog summarizes the files that failed to be re-indexed.

Check the Property Re-Indexing Status

1. Launch the Autodesk Data Management Console.
2. Select a vault.
3. Select Actions > Re-index File Properties.
   * If a vault is currently being re-indexed, the Re-Index File Properties Status dialog is displayed indicating the current progress.
   * If re-indexing has finished or has been stopped, the Re-Index File Properties dialog is displayed. Click Status to view the status of the last re-indexing operation.

**Parent page:** [Indexing Properties](GUID-18ECEB1E-C617-4469-A631-D397F827E0BA.htm)


#### Stop Re-Indexing

# Stop Re-Indexing

Stop the re-indexing process on a vault.

Note: Once stopped, any properties re-indexed up to that point are retained.

1. In the Re-Index File Properties Status dialog, click Stop.
2. You are prompted to confirm stopping the re-indexing operation.
   * Click OK to stop re-indexing.

#### View Re-Indexing Details

# View Re-Indexing Details

Review the results of the re-indexing process.

1. In the Re-Index File Properties Status dialog, click Details.
2. The files and file types that failed to re-index are listed. Click Report to save the list in a text file.

Possible reasons for a file failing to re-index include:

* An error occurred during the property extraction for an individual file. If an individual file fails to re-index and the corresponding iFilter is registered and can be loaded, then the failure is with the file and not the file type. Check the failed file to make sure it is not corrupted.
* The iFilter for a particular file type cannot be loaded. If a file cannot be re-indexed because the corresponding iFilter cannot be loaded, the file type is listed. Re-register the necessary iFilter.
* The iFilter is missing. If a file cannot be re-indexed because of a missing iFilter, that file type will be skipped each time it is encountered during the re-indexing operation.

If any files fail to re-index, either correct the corrupted file or make sure the iFilter for the specified file type is registered and then run the re-indexing operation again.

#### Enable Content Indexing

# Enable Content Indexing

Enable Content Indexing in Vault so users can perform full content searches in Vault client applications.

This enables you to search throughout a vault for a specific text string within a known file type, as well as file properties. The Content Indexing Service must be turned on to perform full content searching in any of the clients. By default, textual content is not indexed.

Note: In a multi-site environment, only files at the local site are returned for a full content search.

1. Launch the Autodesk Data Management Server console.
2. From the navigation pane, select a vault.
3. Select Actions > Content Indexing Service.

Enable Content Indexing

1. Select Yes, enable Content Indexing Service.
2. When the content indexing service enabled, click **OK**.

Disable Content Indexing

#### Rebuild Search Indexes

# Rebuild Search Indexes

Search indexing collects property values from a vault and places them in indexes to give faster search results.

You might want to rebuild search indexes if you notice that searches are taking longer than usual. It is also possible that a vault client will display a message stating that the indexes need to be rebuilt. You can rebuild for individual sites; you can also rebuild for all sites at once, but this can impact performance depending on when you do it and how many sites there are.

## Rebuild Search Indexes for One Site

1. Open the ADMS Console.
2. Browse to the site under the Workgroups node.
3. Right-click the site and select Rebuild Site Search Indexes.

   ![](../images/adms-rebuild-index-site.png)

## Rebuild Search Indexes for All Sites

1. Open the ADMS Console.
2. Select Tools > Rebuild All Search Indexes.

   ![](../images/adms-rebuild-index-sites-all.png)

## Check Indexing Status

* In the ADMS Console, select Tools > View Server Tasks.

  ![](../images/adms-server-tasks.png)

If an index is being rebuilt, you will see "Search indexing" listed as a task for the site.

#### Index AutoCAD Title Block Attribute Properties

# Index AutoCAD Title Block Attribute Properties

Enable AutoCAD block attribute property values in Vault.

When adding AutoCAD-based files to the vault, you can map block attribute properties to vault properties.

Each block has to be enabled by name with the following process. Once enabled, each attribute of the specified block is available to be mapped to a vault property. For more information on block attribute properties, see the Help for the corresponding AutoCAD-based product.

1. Launch the Autodesk Data Management Server Console.
2. Select Tools > Index Block Attributes.
3. In the Index Block Attributes dialog box, click New.
4. Enter the name of the attributed block containing the values you want to expose in vault.
5. Click OK to add the block name.
6. Check in a DWG containing the specified block. If the DWG is already checked in, check it out and back in or execute a reindex.

   Note: If you prefer to use the prompt instead of an attribute tag, you can choose to do so. To use the prompt instead of the attribute tag when it is available, enable the "Extract attribute prompt when available" check box. If this check box is turned on and there is no prompt, the attribute tag is used.

Note: For more information and complete instructions for mapping and managing file properties, see Managing File Properties.

#### Enable Revit Indexing

# Enable Revit Indexing

The Revit Indexing Service deeply indexes Revit family files, including family parameters and objects, so that you can search Revit family files with the Revit Vault Add-in. This feature must be enabled before you can search Revit family files.

Important: By default, the Revit Indexing Service is not enabled as an option until you install the Autodesk Revit Interoperability plug-in during the Vault server installation.

Once the Revit Plug-in for Vault Professional (server) package is installed, you can enable the Revit Indexing Service.

Enable Revit Indexing with the ADMS Console

1. Launch the ADMS Console.
2. Right-click on the Vault that you want to index for Revit Family Search and select Revit Indexing Service.

   You can also select Revit Indexing Service from the Actions menu.
3. On the Revit Indexing Service dialog, select Yes, enable the Revit Indexing Service.
4. Click OK to save your selection.

   Note: The Vault server starts indexing objects in family files. Depending on the number of family files in the vault, the initial indexing could take some time.

   You can now use Revit Family Search on the Load from Vault dialog.

### Multi-Site Environments

# Multi-Site Environments

The multiple site environment allows users to design products across multiple locations as if all the users were in one location. There are two different methods to accommodate this functionality.

The first method is to centralize the database for all sites. The database for Vault can sit on a separate server as illustrated here.

![](../images/multi-site2.png)

The second method is to set up a main site with the database and main file store located on the same server. The main site has the most users and is where the most design work is done.

![](../images/multi-site.png)

In these environments, users open data files such as AutoCAD drawings, Inventor Assemblies, or Microsoft Office documents from their local file Store. All metadata is read from and written to a central database so that users can open large files much faster than if they copy them across the Wide Area Network (wan)

Note: Setting up the main site first and then accessing the main site remotely provides satisfactory performance for some users. We recommend that you set up the main site and then expand to a multiple site.

Note: This feature is available in Autodesk Vault Professional.

**Delete a Site**

1. In the navigation pane, select Sites.
2. Right-click a site in the list and then select Delete Site.
3. If any vaults on the selected site contain data that has not been replicated to other sites, you are prompted to verify deletion of the site. Click Yes to delete the site without replicating the data or click No to cancel the site deletion so that the data can be replicated first.
4. If all of the data at the selected site has been replicated to other sites, you are prompted to verify the deletion of the site. Click Yes.

Note: To remove a site and prevent it from automatically being included, change the vault administration password.

**Delete an AVFS**

1. Expand the File Stores node.
2. Right click the AVFS site in the list and then select Delete Site.

Note: Ensure that all files have been successfully replicated to the ADMS Server. Files stored on the remote AVFS site will remain in the file store location. However, once the site is removed, replication will cease. Any files that were not replicated from the AVFS site to the ADMS Server may be permanently lost.

### Workgroups

# Workgroups

You can replicate file stores from one site to another site. This process is managed by one Microsoft SQL database. The configuration used in replication is known as a workgroup.

The following illustration shows a typical workgroup configuration. All sites in a single workgroup share the same Microsoft SQL server.

To allow sites to have their own database server to increase SQL performance, Vault uses connected workgroups. The following illustration shows a workgroup with two different sites connected to a second workgroup with a single site.

### Replication

# Replication

Replication is the process of copying data from one server to another server usually located in two different physical locations. This process allows the setup of a Vault environment which has two different locations so users will not have to spend time downloading large CAD files across their Wide Area Network (wan) connection.

This enables people to work on files locally; when one is needed from the other office, they can transfer it. Files can be transferred either on demand or on a schedule. Make sure to have adequate space at all your locations for the number of files that you plan on using.

The connected [workgroups](GUID-43F8432F-5022-4F1C-A407-9A50BF56AD0C.htm) feature supports the use of multiple database servers using Microsoft SQL Publisher/Subscriber technology. This technology allows the replication of the SQL database at multiple locations.

Note: Data replication is available only in a multi-site environment. Replicate data prior to creating a back up.

The SQL database tracks which files and versions are at each site in a multi-site environment. Each site can be synchronized so that newer files and newer versions are shared across sites. Individual vaults can be replicated, or all of the enabled vaults on a site can be replicated. Replication can also be scheduled. By default, replication is set for 12:00 AM (midnight) each weekday when a vault is enabled.

#### Select Files and Folders for Scheduled Replication

# Select Files and Folders for Scheduled Replication

Select which Vault folders and files are replicated at subscriber sites during [scheduled replication](GUID-CAA66FBD-7654-41B0-A7B9-B0EB60B61804.htm).

Rules for Replicating Files and Folders

* Only the selected folders and files are replicated during scheduled replication.
* On-demand replication still sends folder and files to the designated subscriber site regardless of whether they are scheduled for replication.
* All meta-data are replicated at subscriber sites regardless of whether the files containing the associated metadata are scheduled for replication.

  Tip: Limit visibility of files and meta-data at subscriber sites by applying appropriate security to the folders and files.

Replicate Files and Folders

1. Open the Autodesk Data Management Server Console.
2. In the navigation pane select the Vault workgroup for which you want to replicate folders and files.
3. In the right pane, right-click the vault and select Replicated Folders.
4. By default all folders are checked. Uncheck any folders which do not need to be scheduled for replication. Check folders which need to be replicated per the schedule.

Right click to check all, uncheck all, expand all, or collapse all.

#### Configure Replication Priority

# Configure Replication Priority

Use Replication Priority to set up a preferred list of Sites or a selected Site for file replication. With Replication priority, you can prioritize Sites within the preferred Sites list.

Organize priority based on site proximity or network conditions. For example, give priority to sites that are geographically close instead of on another continent. Also consider load-balancing when making your choices. The network at a particular site might be busy and unsuitable for additional traffic.

Once Replication Priority has been set up for a Site, any subsequent file replication (both-on-demand-and-scheduled) uses the preferred list of Sites.

Configure Replication Priority

1. On the Server Console, select a Site by expanding the Workgroups node and then by expanding the workgroup the Site is in.
2. Optional: Right-click on a site and select Edit Site Description to give it a more descriptive name.

   This can make it easier later when sorting site names in the priority list; for example, include the city name so that your site is named something like "MLDTVRPPUB3 (chicago)".
3. Right-click on the site and select Manage Replication Priority.
4. On the Manage Replication Priority dialog, add Sites to the Prioritized section by using the Add button.
5. Prioritize Sites in the Prioritized section by using the Move Up and Move Down buttons.
6. Click OK to save your changes.

Note: By default, there are no preferred Sites for any Site. In other words, for every site, the rest of the Sites in the environment appear in the Not Prioritized section by default.

Among the Sites that are in the Prioritized section, the one at the top of the list is the most preferred Site and the one at bottom of the list is the least preferred Site. If a file is not available at the most preferred Site or if that Site cannot be reached for some reason, the Site that is next in the list is approached for replication of the file. If none of the Sites in the Prioritized section have the file or cannot be reached for some reason, a site from the Not Replicated section is selected at random.

Replication Priority for a Site can be set up from any Site. It is not necessary to log into a Site to set up Replication Priority for that Site.

The preferred list for a Site can be quickly viewed in the Replication Priority table on the right by highlighting the Site under the Workgroups node.

#### Turn File Compression On and Off

# Turn File Compression On and Off

File Compression reduces the size of data (file-bits) that is sent back and forth between Client and Server and also between Servers.

By default, File Compression is ON for file replication (site-to-site) and OFF for file transfers (client-to-server uploads and downloads). However, it can be manually configured, as explained in the following sections.

## File Replication (site-to-site)

Follow these instructions to toggle the file compression for site-to-site replication.

1. Locate the Web.config file.

   The default location is C:\Program Files\Autodesk\Vault Server <year>\Server\Web\Services
2. Open the file and add the following key under the appSettings section of the Web.config file:

   ```
   <add key="CompressReplicatedFiles" value="true"/>
   ```

Note: Even though the key is not present by default in the config file, File Compression is ON by default for site-to-site file replication.

3. Set the value to false to turn file compression off.

   You can enable File Compression again at any time by setting the value to true.

## File Transfers (client-to-server)

Follow these instructions to toggle the file compression for client-to-server file transfers.

1. Locate the config file for the Vault Client for which you want to configure file compression.

   For instance, if you would like to configure compression for uploads and downloads to/from Vault Professional Client, you will modify the Connectivity.VaultPro.dll.config file.

   The default location of the config file for Vault Client is C:\Program Files\Autodesk\Vault Client <year>\Explorer
2. Open the file and add the following key to the AppSettings section:

   ```
   <add key="CompressFileTransfers" value="false"/>
   ```

   Note: Even though the key is not present by default in the config file, File Compression is OFF by default for file transfers.
3. To enable File Compression, set the value to true.

   Note: Turning ON compression for file transfers might result in increased memory consumption on the Server.

   Tip: client-to-server file transfers can be faster by turning ON File Compression when the Client and Server are connected over a WAN with low bandwidth.

   To disable File Compression in the future, set the value to false.

Each application needs to be configured separately for compression of file transfers between that application and the Server. For Inventor, the CompressFileTransfers key needs to be added to the appSettings section of Inventor.exe.config (default location is C:\Program Files\Autodesk\Inventor <year>\Bin) and for AutoCAD, it needs to be added to appSettings section of acad.exe.config (default location is C:\Program Files\Autodesk\AutoCAD *<year>*).

#### Removing Replication Environment During Upgrade

# Removing Replication Environment During Upgrade

Vault 2022 upgrade supports a new replication technology that provides a more stable environment.

If you have an existing replication setup, you are prompted to remove and re-create the replication environment manually upon launching the ADMS console.

* Click Proceed to remove the existing replication environment.

  Note: Before you proceed, you may choose to log all the details of the existing replication environment in the ADMS console log so that you can manually set up the new replication environment. By default, the checkbox is enabled.
* Click Cancel if you do not want to proceed with the operation. You won't be able to launch the ADMS console server.

  Note: To uninstall the replication setup manually, you must first uninstall Vault 2022 and then revert to the previous Vault install. Once you finish uninstalling the replication setup, install Vault 2022.

See [Replication](GUID-D8678874-4839-41AD-BD58-226AF3862D3D.htm) for information on how to set up a new replication environment.

### Server Tasks

# Server Tasks

Autodesk uses several background processes to perform common housekeeping chores to ensure that the system runs optimally. The administrator has the ability to view which background processes are running on the server and how often they run by accessing the View Server Tasks dialog.

The Server Tasks dialog contains the following information:

* **A status icon** Indicates whether the task is active or inactive but scheduled to run again
* **Server Task** The name of the server task.
* **Start/Scheduled** The time at which the server task began or is scheduled to begin.
* **Site** The name of the site associated with the server task.
* **Vault** The name of the vault associated with the server task.
* **Period** The type of frequency with which the server task is executed. For example, a server task could be recurring or executed only on-demand.
* **Frequency (minutes)**-The number of minutes before the next execution of the process.

## Background Processes

| Task | Description |
| --- | --- |
| File Store Validation | Compares database metadata against the file store to determine if all of the files in the database exist in the file store. |
| File Store Replication  Note:  Vault Professional Only | Copies files that exist on one site's file store to another site's file store where the specific files do not exist. This process is scheduled by the user. |
| File Store Cleanup | The file store cleanup process removes files from the file store that have been deleted from the data management environment. This process is also known as the Vacuum Cleanup. |
| Update Statistics | Runs Update Statistics on the SQL database. This process improves query performance, which in turn improves vault performance. |
| ERP Packaging  Note:  Vault Professional Only | Communicates with an existing ERP system. ERP Integration must be enabled. |
| Property Re-indexing | Extracts properties from a bulk of files and updates the database with the new information. This operation can be started and stopped by the user. If the operation is stopped and restarted later, it will start with the last file processed. |
| Search Indexing | Takes properties from the database into the indexer for the first time. This indexing yields faster results when the user searches the database on specific properties. |
| Content Indexing Service | Extracts the full text contents from existing files in the vault, allowing full content searching. This process only runs if full-content searching is enabled. If full-content searching is enabled and you attach a vault, this process will initiate. If anything interrupts this process, it will continue from where it left once it is restarted. |
| Search Index Optimization | Updates the indexing engine which helps return search results quickly. When the process is running, the indexer is locked. This process runs during off hours to prevent user down time. If this process does not run, the vault server would have to index on demand, which would cause slower performance during peak use times. |
| Content Indexing Service Update | Adds newly created and updated content to the vault server's search index. This process runs every twenty minutes once full content searching is enabled. |
| Item Lock Cleanup  Note:  Vault Professional Only | When the vault server and the SQL server perform different actions on the database, it will apply locks to prevent data collision. If something interrupts these processes, these locks may never be removed. The item lock cleanup process runs through the database and removes any lock that is left behind. To change the time of the item lock index process, you need to edit the Web.config file.  You can locate the Web.config file at C:\Program Files\Autodesk\Vault Server <year>\Server\Web\Services\Web.config. Look for this line and change the value to the time that you desire.   ``` <!--time of day to clear entity locks. -->  ``` &lt;addkey="LockVacuumTime"value="3:0:0"/&gt;</code></pre></td></tr><tr class="ruled-even-row"><td class="table-body"><p class="table-body">Delete Object Cleanup</p></td><td class="table-body"><p class="table-body">Performs system maintenance by removing orphaned rows in the database.</p></td></tr><tr class="ruled-odd-row"><td class="table-body"><p class="table-body">Calculate Property Compliance</p></td><td class="table-body"><p class="table-body">Makes sure files are meeting property policies and equivalence evaluations.</p></td></tr><tr class="ruled-even-row"><td class="table-body"><p class="table-body">Object Change Notifications</p></td><td class="table-body"><p class="table-body">Makes sure internal server data is kept in-sync when objects are changed by user or system actions.</p></td></tr><tr class="ruled-odd-row"><td class="table-body"><p class="table-body">Selective Purge</p><div><a name="NOTE_355E0F7D46B64B728BD78E563372E3C2"></a><div class="note-note"><span class="label label-target-language">Note: </span><p><a name="P_4C600C121A704FDB84120F02BFC47F3B"></a>Vault Professional Only</p></div></div></td><td class="table-body"><p class="table-body">Removes versions and purge files controlled by the lifecycle definition.</p></td></tr></tbody></table> ``` ``` |

### Users, Groups, and Roles

# Users, Groups, and Roles

Administrators can grant users access to a vault, create and assign roles, and create user groups.

The Global Settings Security tab contains options for granting user access to a vault and assigning user permissions. You can also create groups of users as well as assign access privileges and roles to the groups. The roles assigned to a user or group define the permissions of the user or members of the group.

**Access**

1. Select Tools > Administration > Global Settings.
2. In the Global Settings dialog, select the Security tab.

**Users and Groups**

User and Group accounts are created and administered in the User and Group Management dialog box. You can create a new user or group profile or edit an existing user or group profile.

1. Select Tools > Administration > Global Settings >Security tab.
2. Click Manage Access.

A vault server user account can be created automatically when a Windows user that is a member of an Active Directory group with access to the vault server logs into an Autodesk data management client using Windows authentication. This option is on by default.

Note: The server upon which the Autodesk Vault server is installed must support Windows Authentication.

Note: Windows Authentication is available in the Autodesk Vault Professional.

#### Manage Access

# Manage Access

Create and manage user and group accounts.

User accounts and user groups define user roles, which define levels of access, or access privileges to functions in vault. Anyone who uses and interacts with vault must have a user account, and only an authenticated (i.e.-logged-in) administrator can add or edit user or group access to vault.

**Users**

Select the **Users** tab in the User and Group Management dialog box to create and manage user accounts.

A vault server user account can be created automatically when a Windows user that is a member of an Active Directory group with access to the vault server logs into an Autodesk Vault client using Windows authentication. This option is on by default.

Note: The server upon which the Autodesk Vault server is installed must support Windows Authentication.

* The Users tab lists the user profiles. Click New to create a new user profile or double-click the profile to edit the existing user profile.

Note: Windows Authentication is available in Autodesk Vault Professional.

**Groups**

Select the **Groups** tab in the User and Group Management dialog box to create and manage group profile. A group is a collection of users. Groups let you specify permissions for multiple users, which can make it easier to manage the permissions for those users.

* The Groups tab lists the group profiles. Click New to create a new group profile or double-click the profile to edit the existing group profile.

##### Manage Users

# Manage Users

User accounts are created and administered in the User and Group Management dialog box, and then assigned to vaults.

You can create a new user, view or edit a user profile. You can't delete a user, but you can disable an account so a user can no longer log in to the vault.

In addition to unique display names, users are assigned roles. Roles determine whether or not a user can administer the vaults, create folders, add and delete files, or get data. Each role is defined by a set of permissions. Role-based permissions are additive, so a user assigned multiple roles has all the privileges of the assigned roles. A user that does not have any role assigned and does not belong to a group with a role has no access to the vault. Administrators can create custom roles and assign specific permissions to those roles.

Note: To ensure a secure working environment, it is important to have unique user accounts.

##### Active Directory Accounts and Windows Authentication

# Active Directory Accounts and Windows Authentication

An administrator can create a Vault Server account with credentials unique to the Vault Server or import a Windows Active Directory account.

By using an Active Directory account, users can log into Autodesk data management clients using their Windows account credentials. Users and groups can then be managed using Windows permissions.

Note: Windows Authentication is available in Autodesk Vault Professional.

Domain user accounts and domain user groups can be imported to the Autodesk vault server. This allows for accounts to be created using Active Directory information and allows users to log into a data management client without requiring a new account.

You cannot manage Active Directory accounts through the server console. You can only import Active Directory accounts. To manage Active Directory user accounts and Active Directory group membership, you must use the User Accounts controls in the Windows Control Panel.

# Import an Active Directory Domain User Account

Vault server user accounts imported from an Active Directory domain use username and email address associated with the Active directory account and cannot be edited.

The domain name is displayed in front of the username. Changes made to the Active Directory user account are updated in the vault server user account automatically.

Note: Windows Authentication is available Autodesk Vault Professional.

##### Manage Groups

# Manage Groups

Groups are created and managed in the User and Group Management dialog box. Groups have roles and permissions assigned to them that define the actions they can take and the vaults they can access.

You can create groups of users and assign roles and permissions to the group. As a member of a group, a user has all the permissions and roles assigned to the group. By default, every new user is added to a group called Everyone. The Everyone group is only available on an Access Control Lists. It does not appear in the Group Profile dialog box. If the Everyone group is granted membership to a folder, all new users have access to that folder.

Groups can be comprised of users or other groups. Groups can be disabled, turning off all permissions assigned to the group. The permissions and roles assigned to a group are independent of individual user roles and permissions. Groups can also be restricted to specific folders within a vault, so you can keep projects and other data secure between groups.

By assigning users to groups and then granting folder membership to those groups, you can easily manage users and their access to vault folders. This is the best practice for creating a vault security model.

Note: Folder membership is only available with the vault server that is installed with Autodesk Vault.

A Group Manager can be assigned to a group to manage the group members. The Group Manager can manage only the groups they are given to, allowing for distributed administration of groups.

As a Group Manager, you can:

* View groups with profile attributes.
* Add or remove members from the group. All other fields are not editable. Refer to [Edit a group profile](GUID-5D92843C-3B99-4AAE-A32E-174C47CF6CAB.htm) for more information.

Note:

* A group manager must have User Read permissions to manage users of the group.
* Parent group's manager can't manage its subgroup.
* A group manager doesn't inherit group assigned roles/vaults.

Domain Groups can also have group managers who can add or remove group members. However, only administrator can update the domain group.

# Active Directory Domain Groups

An administrator can create a group of users on the Autodesk Vault server or domain user groups can be imported, retaining the group membership and security settings. Groups can then be managed using Windows permissions. Importing a domain group imports all members of the group as well as sub-groups.

Note: Windows Authentication is available Autodesk Vault Professional.

This allows for accounts to be created using Active Directory information and allows users to log into a data management client without requiring a new account. If a user account or group already exists on the vault server, it can be imported to an Active Directory account or group.

You cannot manage Active Directory accounts through the server console. To manage Active Directory user accounts and Active Directory group membership, you must use the User Accounts controls in the Windows Control Panel.

###### Import an Active Directory Domain Group

# Import an Active Directory Domain Group

Import a Vault Server Group from an Active Directory Domain.

Note: Windows Authentication is available in Autodesk Vault Professional.

Note: You must be assigned the role of Administrator to perform this operation.

1. Select **Tools > Administration > Global Settings**.
2. In the **Global Settings** dialog box, select the Security tab.
3. Click **Manage Access**.
4. In the **User and Group Management** dialog box, select a Vault Server group and then select **Actions > Import Domain Group**.
5. In the **Select Groups** dialog box, click **Locations** to specify the domain containing the Active Directory group to which the selected vault server group is to be mapped. In the Locations dialog box, select the domain to use and then click OK.
6. In the **Select Groups** dialog box, enter the name of the Active Directory domain group to which the vault server group is to be imported, or click **Advanced** to search for the group.
7. Once the group has been specified, click **OK** in the **Select Groups** dialog box. The vault server group information is replaced with the domain group information.

All members of the group and subgroups are imported. Groups imported from an Active Directory domain retain the group name and email address from Active Directory. The domain name is displayed in front of the group name.

Note: An imported domain group can be updated to reflect changes to the Active Directory group membership. For more information, see Update a Domain Group.

###### Update Domain Groups

# Update Domain Groups

If members have been added or removed from the Active Directory domain group, the Vault Server group can be updated to reflect the changes to the group.

One advantage to using groups is when you are adding users to a vault or vaults. First, create a group and add members to the group. Once members have been added to the group, assign a vault to the group.

Note: You must be assigned the role of Administrator to perform this operation.

1. Select Tools > Administration > Global Settings.
2. In the Global Settings dialog box, select the Security tab.
3. Click Manage Access.
4. In the User and Group Management dialog box, select the Groups tab.
5. Select a group and then select Actions > Update Domain Group.

Note: Updating Active Directory users in group memberships will not take immediate effect until the user logs out and back into the Windows Operating System.

###### Link Domain Users and Groups

# Link Domain Users and Groups

When importing domain users and groups, the user names and group names are compared with existing vault server users and groups. If a vault server user account or group already exists with the same name as the imported domain user or group, you are prompted to link the existing vault server account with the imported domain account.

The Linking Users and Groups dialog lists the domain name and the matching vault server name that will be mapped to it. You can accept or reject any of the proposed mappings. All mappings are accepted by default.

1. Turn off the check box next to a proposed link to reject the link. If a mapping is rejected, the domain user or group is imported as a new user or group.
2. Turn on a check box next to a proposed link to accept the link. If a mapping is accepted, the domain user or group is merged with the existing user or group.
3. Click OK.

#### Vault Gateway

# Vault Gateway

With Vault Gateway, members of your team can remotely connect to the vault.

Vault Gateway technology securely connects remote devices to Vault servers through a cloud service. The Vault Gateway service generates a URL used in place of the Vault server name when logging into the Vault client software (e.g.,-vault-client,-add-ins,-etc). The cloud service interfaces with the vault server, exchanging data between the client and server in real time.

Configuring and using Vault Gateway doesn't require any of the following network resources:

* Connection to an on-premise network.
* Connection to a VPN.
* Opened inbound network ports.

Vault administrators [manage their team's gateway](GUID-EAFBBCDF-F432-4F30-8B96-C9AD013957DE.htm) in the ADMS Console. Administrators must verify that the [requirements to use Vault Gateway](GUID-49EC8651-D072-40DF-B6FB-5335631327E7.htm) are satisfied to configure a gateway.

Team members [connect to a gateway](GUID-81EBA415-CE0F-427F-92CF-80BBF16374B0.htm) when they log into the Vault Client.

Autodesk supports Vault Gateway for the current release of Vault Server and three previous releases.

##### Vault Gateway Requirements

# Vault Gateway Requirements

Learn about the technical requirements for using Vault Gateway.

Setting up Vault Gateway requires the following Vault installation and configuration:

* A subscription to Vault Professional with all components installed.
  + Vault Gateway will be compatible with the most recent version of Vault software and three previous versions released prior to 2026.
    For example, if Vault 2026 is the most recent version of Vault, Vault Gateway is supported by 2025, 2024, 2023.
* A fully migrated *KnowledgeVaultMaster* database.
* An Autodesk account that is also an Autodesk Account team administrator.
* The Vault Server's default website needs a site binding configured to allow local HTTP requests on port 80.
  + The localhost address may be **127.0.0.1** (ipv4) or **::1** (IPv6), depending on your TCP/IP protocol version.

Gateways are administered per Autodesk Account team. Learn more about teams [here](https://knowledge.autodesk.com/search-result/caas/simplecontent/content/autodesk-account-teams.html).

##### Manage Vault Gateway

# Manage Vault Gateway

View and configure gateways in the ADMS Console.

Administrators configure gateways for individual [Autodesk Account teams](https://knowledge.autodesk.com/search-result/caas/simplecontent/content/autodesk-account-teams.html). A Vault administrator must manage at least one Autodesk Account team to configure a gateway.

## Manage Vault Gateway

To manage your team's gateway:

1. In the ADMS Console, select **Tools** in the menu bar and go to **Administration**.
2. In the **Global Settings**, select the Network Settings tab.
3. In the **Vault Gateway Management**, click on the **Configure...** button. If you're not signed in, you will be prompted to sign into an administrator account.
4. The Autodesk Account Teams window displays if you manage more than one team. Select a team and click **OK**. The Vault Gateways window displays.

   Note: When a gateway is already configured, the Autodesk Account Teams window doesn't display.

The Vault Gateways window is the primary dashboard for your team's gateways. It shows information for the local gateway that you manage and other gateways for your team. Click **Refresh** to update the status of the local gateway and the list of other gateways.

### Local Gateway

The following fields and buttons provide information on the local gateway configured for your team:

* **Host Name**: The host name of the gateway, used to connect Vault Clients to the server. Click the Copy URL icon (![](../images/icon_vault_gateway_copy_host_name_URL.png)) to copy the host name to your clipboard.

**Parent page:** [Vault Gateway](GUID-725723AF-CCFD-48A2-8A20-C332B9A75608.htm)


##### Delete a Vault Gateway

# Delete a Vault Gateway

Administrators can permanently delete a gateway and its gateway URL.

After deleting a gateway, your team can no longer use the gateway URL. The effect of this is twofold:

Deleting a gateway is irreversible.

* Team members can't use the URL to connect to the vault.
* Administrators can't re-use the URL when configuring a new gateway.

To delete a gateway:

1. In the ADMS Console, click the **Tools** option in the menu bar.
2. Select **Manage Vault Gateway**. If you're not signed in, you will be prompted to sign into an administrator account.
3. If you manage more than one Autodesk Account team, the Autodesk Account Teams window displays. Select a team and click **OK**. The Vault Gateways window displays.
4. Click **Delete** to delete the local gateway. To delete a gateway in the Other Gateways section, select the ![](../images/icon-vault-gateway-delete-other-gateway.png) icon in the Action column to delete the corresponding gateway.

**Parent page:** [Vault Gateway](GUID-725723AF-CCFD-48A2-8A20-C332B9A75608.htm)


##### Pause or Resume a Vault Gateway

# Pause or Resume a Vault Gateway

Vault Gateway allows administrators to temporarily limit access to the local gateway service with pause or resume operation.

When a gateway is paused, team members can't use the gateway URL to connect to the vault. Unlike when an administrator [deletes a gateway](GUID-207B0F56-6240-4420-9D2B-01D69721BE51.htm), the URL remains valid for team members to use when access to the gateway is resumed. Pausing a service causes it to suspend operation but doesn't remove the service. Resume a paused service to continue functioning.

To pause or resume access to a gateway:

1. In the ADMS Console, click the **Tools** option in the menu bar.
2. Select **Manage Vault Gateway**. If you're not signed in, you will be prompted to sign into an administrator account.
3. The Local Gateway section contains either a Pause or Resume button.
   1. Click **Pause** to stop access to the gateway URL.
   2. Click **Resume** to restore access to the gateway URL.

**Parent page:** [Vault Gateway](GUID-725723AF-CCFD-48A2-8A20-C332B9A75608.htm)


##### Configure Proxy Server

# Configure Proxy Server

Configure proxy server settings to connect to the local gateway.

If your server cannot access the internet location directly, you can configure access through the proxy. A proxy server enhances network security by providing controls for receiving and forwarding (or-rejecting) requests between isolated networks.

To configure a proxy server:

1. In the ADMS Console, click the **Tools** option in the menu bar.
2. Select **Manage Vault Gateway.** If you're not signed in, you will be prompted to sign into an administrator account.
3. Click **Proxy Server** to set a proxy for the local gateway.
4. In the Configure Proxy Server dialog,

   * Select the **Enable Proxy** checkbox.
   * Enter the proxy server address, including the port number.
   * If the proxy server requires authentication, select **Enable Proxy Authentication** checkbox.

     Enter the username and password the proxy server requires for authentication.
   * Click **OK** to save the changes.

Note: This proxy server setting is limited to Vault Gateway.

**Parent page:** [Vault Gateway](GUID-725723AF-CCFD-48A2-8A20-C332B9A75608.htm)


##### Connect to a Vault Gateway

# Connect to a Vault Gateway

Connect remotely to Vault client software with Vault Gateway.

Note: Vault Gateway doesn't support logging in with Windows authentication.

After Vault Gateway is configured by your administrator, team members can use the gateway URL to connect to their vault remotely.

## Password Complexity

Your account password must satisfy Vault Gateway's password complexity requirements to sign in.

Passwords must contain eight or more characters, with at least one number and letter.

Note: The following are valid special characters: !"#$%&'()\*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^\_`{|}~

## Connect to a Gateway

Logging into a gateway follows the same procedure as logging into a vault through a direct server connection. The **Server** field takes an HTTPS URL to the gateway (a-gateway's-host-name,-displayed-when-an-administrator-manages-a-gateway) instead of a server name. Vault clients can't connect to the gateway if *https://* is omitted from the URL.

##### Vault Gateway faq

# Vault Gateway faq

Refer to these Frequently Asked Questions (faq) to better understand how the Vault Gateway works.

**How secure is the connection from the Vault Gateway to the Vault Server?**

    The local agent, installed on the Vault server, makes a secure connection to the Vault Gateway service using HTTPS protocol.

**What information is stored in the Vault Gateway?**

    Vault data is not stored in the Vault Gateway.

**What Vault authentication methods can be used with Vault Gateway?**

    A Vault account or Autodesk ID must be used to connect to a Vault Server through the Vault Gateway. Windows Authentication will not work through the Vault Gateway.

**What kind of Denial-of-Service attack protection is in the Vault Gateway service?**

    Vault Gateway service limits the number of requests per period of time (minute/etc.) that can be made to each Vault server.

**How do I get a license if I use the Vault Gateway and not on my network?**

    If you are using network licenses, your users will need to borrow a license, or you will have to make the license manager reachable on the internet.

**Can I use sso with Vault Gateway?**

    Autodesk ID can be integrated with a company's Active Directory using Autodesk sso. See [About Single Sign-on (sso)](https://knowledge.autodesk.com/search-result/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/ENU/ssoGUIDE-Okta-Guide/files/ssoGUIDE-Okta-Guide-About-Single-Sign-on-sso-html-html.html).

**What are the password requirements needed to use Vault-authenticated accounts with the Vault Gateway?**

    All passwords must be a minimum of eight characters, with at least one letter and one number. Blank passwords are blocked from using the Vault Gateway.

**Is data encrypted during transit?**

    Yes. The Vault Gateway connection uses the HTTPS protocol for communications.

**Can we limit who can use the Vault Gateway service?**

    Any user with the Vault Gateway URL and a Vault account will use the connection.

**What has to be installed on the client workstations to use the Vault Gateway?**

    Additional software is not required to use the Vault Gateway.

**Will all Vault clients and add-ins be able to use the Vault Gateway?**

    All clients, excluding the Vault Thin Client, can use the Vault Gateway.

**Does the Vault Gateway support multifactor authentication?**

    Multifactor authentication can be used if the Autodesk ID is integrated with the company's sso service. See [About Single Sign-on (sso)](https://knowledge.autodesk.com/search-result/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/ENU/ssoGUIDE-Okta-Guide/files/ssoGUIDE-Okta-Guide-About-Single-Sign-on-sso-html-html.html).

**Can this be put on a different server in the DMZ and communicate with our Vault client on-prem?**

    No, it is a part of the Vault Server (adms-console).

**Reporting - Can we tell where users are connecting from (regions-as-an-example)?**

    Not currently. All users connecting to the Vault Server will show in the Audit log connecting from "127.0.0.1". We are planning to enhance this in a future release.

**Are there other IP type restrictions that we could implement to make this more controllable on our end?**

    No.

**How is the Vault Gateway itself secured?**

    The Vault Gateway cloud service uses Autodesk CloudOS and is built with Autodesk Forge security best practices. All traffic to and from the Vault Gateway is encrypted.

**Is the Vault Gateway located within the continental US?**

    Services locations originate in the continental United States, Europe (ireland), and Australia.

**Can the location of the Vault Gateway be configured?**

    Yes, this is chosen when the Admin configures the Vault Gateway.

**Does the Vault Gateway store any data or metadata?**

    Vault data is not stored in the Vault Gateway. The data simply passes through the gateway.

**Does the gateway mechanism support integration with OKTA identity management?**

    Autodesk ID supports MFA (multifactor-authentication), and also supports sso (Single Sign-on) with third-party systems, [including OKTA](https://help.autodesk.com/view/ssoGUIDE/ENU/?guid=ssoGUIDE_Okta_Guide_About_Single_Sign_on_sso_html), and this would work for Vault Gateway as well.

**Is it a single-tenant environment, for example where each customer receives a dedicated cloud virtual machine?**

    There are no "cloud virtual machines" created for each gateway. A gateway is a logical construct, with many gateways served by a single cloud application.

**Does Autodesk perform any penetration or vulnerability testing on Vault Gateway?**

    Autodesk performs standard security testing that complies with industry best practices.

**What are the Vault Server firewall requirements to connect to the Vault Gateway?**

    The Vault Server needs outbound HTTPS access to the internet to connect to the service. Inbound ports do not have to be opened in the firewall to use the Vault Gateway.

    To allow Vault Server firewalls to operate correctly, allow outbound HTTPS traffic with \*.autodesk.com in the firewall.

    To activate Vault Gateway, allow outbound HTTP traffic with \*.autodesk.com in the firewall.

##### Vault Connector FAQs

# **Vault Connector FAQs**

**Question: Can a single license be used for Vault Gateway and Vault Connector?**

    A: Yes, when both services are running on the same machine.

**Question: Does the Vault Connector require Vault Gateway?**

    A: No

**Question: Is data encrypted during transit?**

    A: Yes, the Vault Connector connection to Fusion Manage uses HTTPS protocol for communications.

**Question: Can multiple vaults connect to the same Fusion Manage tenant and workspace?**

    A: Yes, however, Item numbering will have to be taken into consideration since vaults do not share numbering schemes.

**Question: Do the Vault Connector need an APS app?**

    A: No, it does not need an APS app.

**Question: Do all engineers require a Vault PLM license, or can Fusion Manage and Vault Professional individual licenses be used together?**

    A: No, if the user already has one product license, they can get the license for the other product separately.

**Question: Is a specific tenant template required to use the connector, or how can an existing environment be used with the connector?**

    A: Yes, use the Items Workspace in the Fusion Manage Template library.

**Question: How to perform the initial load of existing Vault items to Fusion Manage when starting the implementation?**

    A: Multiple Items from Item Master or Search Results grid can be selected and then use the Sync to Fusion Manage command.

**Question: What should I consider when they have a Fusion Manage sandbox? Can we also connect their Vault to the Fusion Manage sandbox?**

    A: A Fusion Manage sandbox can be use for testing purpose. A test Vault should be used to connect to the sandbox. Do not use a production vault connected to a sandbox.

**Question: What is required when a customer moves the Vault Server to another server and its name changes?**

    A: No special steps are required. After migration, enable the Vault Connector again in the ADMS Console. The previous Fusion Manage property mappings in the client are retained; no reconfiguration is needed.

**Question: Do I have to register all Vault users in my Fusion tenant and vice versa?**

    A: No, Vault users can still synchronize items to Fusion Manage without access to the Fusion Manage tenant.

**Question: What happens to manual changes of the BOM in Manage when the next sync of Vault gets triggered, will I lose my changes? What kind of changes get preserved?**

    A: The BOM properties will get updated based on the properties mapping. If fields need to be preserved, users can skip the mapping for those fields. BOM links that are not originated from Vault will be preserved.

**Question : Can the connector be used without using Vault Items? If not, how can items be established without causing workload for engineering?**

    A: No. Vault Connector requires the use of Vault Items, which currently are the only Entity Type that can be synced to Fusion Manage.

**Question : Does the connector support the SWX Plugin?**

    A: Vault Items promoted from SWX files are supported to be synced to Fusion Manage.

**Question : Can the connector handle content center parts in a similar way like Upchain (they get released automatically)? Can the content center be synced with Fusion Manage automatically?**

    A: Vault can place a Content Center part in a released state by default when it is first added to Vault. However, since the part did not undergo a state transition, it will not automatically synchronize with Fusion Manage. It will get synchronized when it is used as a component in an assembly, when the assembly gets synchronized, or it can be synchronized manually.

**Question : The connector does not automatically start after a system update or reboot, what should I do?**

    A: In the Computer Management on the system, navigate to the Services list. Locate the Autodesk Vault Connector Server. Edit the properties and change the Startup Type from Manual to Automatic.

## Vault File Server Administration

# Vault File Server Administration

The Vault File Server is a simple file store management system that allows you to move and configure a file store.

Sometimes in multi-site environments a latency can occur when the Autodesk Data Management Server (ADMS) communicates with SQL. To reduce this latency, the File Server talks directly to the adms instead. Similarly, the Vault client(s) communicate directly with the adms for metadata and the File Server for file upload/download events, reducing the time it takes to update the file store.

Important: The File Server machine must be able to access the machine where the adms Console is installed.

Note: Although the File Server supports a multi-site environment, all file replication must be scheduled from the adms Console.

### File Stores

# File Stores

A Vault Server environment consists of two main components: the database component and the file store component.

The database provides the index information for the location of the files, whereas the file store is the physical location of the stored files. Each new vault the environment has a unique database and file store.

The file store location defaults to C:\ProgramData\Autodesk\VaultServer\FileStore.

Note: Never directly move, delete, or edit a file in the file store. Use the Autodesk Data Management Server console to manage the file store.

Each data file is stored in its own folder in a normal, uncompressed format.

#### Remote File Stores

# Remote File Stores

The Vault file store can be set up on a remote computer.

Using a remote file store requires configuring full permissions and accounts. See [Move the File Store to a Mapped Drive or Remote Share](GUID-61DE28F0-8C59-469F-8AE3-AFE728268EBA.htm) for more information about permissions.

The vault supports two basic file store configurations:

* File store located on the Autodesk Vault Server.

  ![](../images/single-vault-cap.png)
* File store located on a remote file server that has a shared folder.

  ![](../images/illustration-privatecontent.png)

You can use a remote file server to host the file store and/or backup and restore vault data. See [Move the File Store to a Mapped Drive or Remote Share](GUID-61DE28F0-8C59-469F-8AE3-AFE728268EBA.htm) for more information.

## Job Server Administration

# Job Server Administration

The Job Server is a feature used to off-load client side jobs from the engineering workstation, e.g. visualization file publishing (DWF) during the check in process.

Publishing visualization files of large assemblies can slow the check in of designs. By off-loading this process, users can quickly check in files and ensure consistent visualization file creation. The Job Server can also be used to synchronize properties, publish PDF files, or execute other custom jobs after a lifecycle change has been invoked on a file.

**Job Server Components**

The Job Server consists of two components:

1. **Job Queue** - A list, or queue, of jobs submitted by clients (Inventor, AutoCAD, Vault, Autoloader) waiting to be processed. This queue is stored in and managed by the Vault Server.
2. **Job Processor** - is a separate application that reserves queued jobs and pulls them from the job server to process them. Since the job processor is installed along with the vault client, any workstation with Autodesk Vault Professional can be used to process jobs.

   You can sign into your Autodesk Account through the Job Processor. Click [here](GUID-2618B248-133F-4B23-AE91-F3209E3E05C2.htm) to learn more.

## How It Works

Jobs are submitted to the job server when:

* A user checks in a file which needs a visualization file created.
* A user invokes an Update View command inside of the Vault client application.
* Autoloader is used to load files into the vault and visualization files are needed.
* A status change occurs on a file and an updated visualization file is needed.
* A user invokes Create PDF, Create DXF, or Create STEP command inside of the Vault client application.
* A status change occurs on a file and an updated PDF, DXF, or STEP file is needed.
* A status change occurs on a file and a custom job is needed.
* A status change occurs on a file and properties need to be synchronized in the file.

![](../images/illust-job-processor-components.png)

## Multi-Site Support for the Job Server

The Job Server supports multi-site environments by logging into a specific server and only processing jobs that are associated with that server. In the illustration below, any job processor that logs into Site B will only process jobs that are at Site B. The same happens for Job Processors in Site A.

![](../images/jobserver-multisite.png)

Important: The Job Server must be [enabled](GUID-1F9F4E1D-9B12-44DF-B005-3AA3025E7B04.htm) before you can send jobs to the server for publishing.

The Job Server Queue dialog allows you to manage jobs that have been queued for publishing. On this dialog you can manually print jobs, resubmit a suspended job, review individual job details, and customize how job queue information is displayed.

![](../images/dialog-jobserverqueue.png)

Note: The **Job Server Queue** dialog is modeless. This means that you can perform other commands and actions while it is open. It can be minimized or moved out of the way if needed.

### Job Server Queue Details

This table describes the details of the Job Server Queue dialog.

| Detail | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Job Type** | The type of job that was submitted for processing. Visualization jobs display as Autodesk.Vault.DWF.Create, where is the file extension. |
| **Submitted By** | Displays the name of the user who submitted the job to the queue. |
| **Submitted Date** | Displays the date and time the job was submitted to the queue. |
| **Job Processor** | Displays the name of the computer that has taken the job from the queue for processing. |
| **Description** | Displays more information about the job in the queue. This field will also display the DWF Create: filename. |
| **Status** | Displays whether the job's status is Pending, Processing, or Error. |
| **Results** | Displays information only if the job has an error status. |

### Job Server Commands

This table describes the commands on the Job Server Queue dialog.

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Close** | Closes the Job Server Queue dialog. |
| **Queued After** | Filters the list by showing the first 1,000 jobs queued after the specified date and time. |
| **Refresh** | Refreshes the queue. |
| **Re-Submit** | Reprocesses a job that has encountered an error. This button is only enabled when a job has been placed in error state. |
| **Remove** | Deletes a submitted job from the queue. |
| **Reset to Queue** | Removes the reservation of a job by the job processor. |
| **Print** | Prints the current queue grid to the default printer. |
| **Take Site Ownership** | Processes jobs submitted to that Site.  When a job is submitted by a Vault Client, it goes into the Job Queue and is only processed by Job Processors connected to that Site. To avoid files being transferred across multiple Sites, a Job Processor will not process jobs submitted to other Sites. |
| **Go To Folder**  Note: Right-click a specific job to see this option. | Locates and highlights the file in the vault. |
| **Set to Top Priority**  Note: Right-click a specific job to see this option. You must be assigned the Job Queue Reserve role to perform this action. | Promote the selected job for the next possible execution.  Example: When a job with Priority 10 is selected, click the 'Set to Top Priority' button. The job will be reprioritized to Priority 1 and processed by the Job Processor immediately. |

### Job Processor Overview

# Job Processor Overview

Learn about the job processor and how it reserves and queues jobs.

The Job Processor is a separate application that reserves queued jobs and pulls them from the job server to process them. Since the job processor is installed along with the Vault client, any workstation with the appropriate edition of Vault can be used to process jobs.

From the Job Processor dialog you can pause and resume processing, set the Vault user account that is used to process jobs, and view the types of jobs that the Job Processor is configured to process.

## Job Processor Dialog Details

| ****Detail**** | ****Description**** |
| --- | --- |
| Job ID | Displays the number of the job currently being processed. |
| Job Type | Displays a description of the job being processed. |
| Description | Displays more information about the job in the queue. |
| Status | Displays the current state of the Job Processor. |
| Status Bar | Displays the server name and the user account. |
| Processing Start Time | Displays the time the Job Processor began working on a job. |
| Job Processor Dialog Details | Autodesk Account: Displays your Autodesk Account username. If it displays "Sign In", click to sign in to Autodesk Account |

## How It Works

Jobs are submitted to the job server when:

* A user checks in a file that needs a visualization file created.
* A user invokes an Update View command inside of the Vault client application.
* Autoloader is used to load files into the vault and visualization files are needed.
* A status change occurs on a file and an updated visualization file is needed.
* A user invokes Create PDF, Create DXF, or Create STEP command inside of the Vault client application.
* A status change occurs on a file and an updated PDF, DXF, or STEP file is needed.
* A status change occurs on a file and a custom job is needed.
* A status change occurs on a file and properties need to be synchronized in the file.

![](../images/image-jobserver-howworks.bmp.bmp)

**Job Processor Licensing**

The Vault Job Processor consumes a license the entire time it is running, even while idle. To return the process, the Job Processor must be stopped/closed.

## Basic Job Processor Tasks

Following are basic tasks you can perform with the Job Processor.

* [Sign in to your Autodesk account](GUID-2618B248-133F-4B23-AE91-F3209E3E05C2.htm)
* [Log into the Job Processor](GUID-5D7F921E-B5C3-4A89-9BB0-A7271FF4010A.htm)

* [Schedule the Job Processor](GUID-4038E3A2-C5F2-4ECA-8599-2B8AA760FDCB.htm)

## Customize the Job Processor

You can customize the job types list and configure job check frequency, task scheduling, and other Job Processor functions to suit your work environment by modifying the JobProcessor.dll.config file.

Individual jobs are processed by Connectivity.JobProcessor.Delegate.Host.exe, a separate application, but the jobs are controlled by JobProcessor.exe.

### Create a Custom Job

# Create a Custom Job

Associate a custom job with a lifecycle transition.

Associate a custom job with a lifecycle transition.

Two steps are necessary to create a custom job. First, an administrator adds a custom job to a lifecycle. Second, a programmer creates the job.

First, add the custom job type to a lifecycle. You must be an administrator to do this.

1. Click Tools > Administration > Vault Settings.
2. On the Vault Settings dialog, click Behaviors tab > Lifecycles.
3. On the Lifecycle Definitions dialog, select a Lifecycle Definition (e.g., Basic Release Process) and then click Edit. The selected definition name appears in the title bar.
4. From the Lifecycle States list, select the lifecycle state to edit and then click the Transitions tab.
5. Click Edit to open the Transitions dialog and select the Custom Job Types tab.
6. Click Add and enter a name in the Add to Input New Custom Job Type Name field. Click OK.

   Note: A typical naming convention is to prefix your company name to any job types.
7. Click OK to exit the Transition dialog.

   This Custom Job Type will be initiated whenever an object transitions through this lifecycle.
8. To enable this Custom Job on other transitions, repeat steps 3 - 5 and specify an existing Custom Job Type instead of creating a new Custom Job.

Next, a programmer creates the job (new plugins to the Job Processor). Jobs are code defined as .NET dlls; you decide what the Job does.

Note: This is intended to run as a service, so avoid UI code.

1. Create a .NET assembly.
2. Set up a procedure.
3. Deploy the procedure to a certain directory location.
4. Configure the Job Processor to find and load the extension. The next time the Job Processor runs it loads your extension.
5. When the Job Processor sees a Job Type that matches one your plugin can handle, the Job Processor will route the job to your plugin code.

**Parent page:** [Job Server Administration](GUID-41C25A0B-81DC-4E5B-B98B-3EA7B280CD97.htm)


### Schedule the Job Processor

# Schedule the Job Processor

Use the Windows Task Scheduler to configure when and how often the Job Processor starts.

You must be logged in with a Windows user account to schedule this task.

1. Open the Windows Task Scheduler.
2. Browse to the JobProcessor.exe file in the <install dir>\Autodesk\Vault [edition]\Explorer\ directory.
3. Configure the frequency and time to start the Job Processor.
4. Save the task.

Note: Be sure to configure the account setting prior to the scheduled task starting for the first time.

This scheduling change only needs to be set once. The Job Processor will use this account each time it runs.

The Job Processor can also be started when a user logs into Windows. This is done by selecting Start on Windows Log in in the Administration menu of the Job Processor dialog.

**Parent page:** [Job Server Administration](GUID-41C25A0B-81DC-4E5B-B98B-3EA7B280CD97.htm)


### Job Processor Command Line

# Job Processor Command Line

The Job Processor can be stopped, paused, and resumed via the command line.

This is useful in situations where users might want the Job Processor to run only during periods of light activity. With this enhancement, a batch file can now be used as a scheduled task in Windows Task Scheduler to control the starting and stopping of the Job Processor. An example of the various command line switches and what they mean can be seen below.

## Override Log In Credentials

*JobProcessor.exe* accepts command line arguments to override the configured user name, password, and ADMS server login credentials by allowing you to use a blank password. For example:

* Vault authentication with a blank password:

  ```
   JobProcessor.exe -u Administrator -p -s MyVaultServer
  ```

  Important: Be careful when storing clear-text passwords in any applications or batch files. Vault takes special care to encrypt the passwords, but only after the JobProcessor.exe reads it.
* Windows authentication:

  ```
  JobProcessor.exe -w -s MyVaultServer
  ```

## Example JobProcessorExample.bat

```
REM start the job processor
start JobProcessor.exe
REM prevents the job processor from processing any more jobs on its queue after finishing its current job
JobProcessor.exe /pause
REM allows the job processor to continue processing jobs on its queue from a paused state
JobProcessor.exe /resume
REM stops and exits the job processor after finishing its current job
JobProcessor.exe /stop
```

It's important to note that the command line options will never interrupt the execution of a job that is already processing. Stopping or pausing the job processor via the command line only modifies the state of the job processor between jobs, similar to how it would behave if paused or stopped from the UI. This is to prevent jobs from partially executing resulting in some jobs never reaching completion or worse, leaving vault data in an inconsistent state.

### How Job Handlers are Loaded

# How Job Handlers are Loaded

Learn about how the Job Processor loads Job Handlers on start-up.

The Job Processor loads both Autodesk and Third Party job handlers.

1. Load all Third Party Job Handlers from the Extension folder
2. Read in the Job Handler configuration information.
3. Load Autodesk's Job Handlers.
4. Associate Job Types with Job Handlers and check if each Job Handler is enabled.

**Third Party Job Handler Extensions**

Each third party extension should exist in its own folder in the **Extension Directory**:

%allusersprofile%\Autodesk\Vault[year]\Extensions\

So, for example, if we had a job handler extension called "JobHandlerSample", it could reside in the directory %allusersprofile%\Autodesk\Vault [year]\Extensions\JobHandlerSample.

For each folder within Extension Directory, the Job Processor checks for a configuration file. The configuration file is a plain text file that can be named anything, but must end with the extension .vcet.config. If the configuration file does not exist, the extension will fail to load. Here are the contents of a sample config file, JobHandlerSample.vcet.config:

```
<configuration>
    <connectivity.ExtensionSettings2>
         <assembly>JobHandlerSample</assembly>
         <extensionType>JobProcessor</extensionType>
    </connectivity.ExtensionSettings2>
</configuration>
```

The **assembly** element specifies the name of the extension dll. So, in our sample above, the extension dll is named JobHandlerSample.dll. The extension type of JobProcessor indicates that this is an extension for the job processor (other extension types can also live in this directory: WebService and VaultClient).

The extension assembly (in our sample, JobHandlerSample.dll) is now loaded. Upon loading the following checks are done:

1. The references of the assembly dll are checked to ensure that it doesn't link against any of the vault dlls (those starting with "Connectivity" In their name). If an extension assembly links to one of these dlls (either directly or indirectly), it will fail to load.
2. The assembly is checked for a single exported type that implements the IJobHandler interface. In our JobHandlerSample example, within our assembly's project we could have the following C# class to implement the IJobHandler interface:

   ```
   namespace JobHandlerSample
   {
       public class JobHandlerSample : IJobHandler
        {
            public bool CanProcess(string-strjobtype)
             {
                return strJobType.Equals("jobhandlersample");
             }

             public JobOutcome Execute(ijobprocessorservices-context,-ijob-job)
              {
                 return JobOutcome.Success;
              }
         }
   }
   ```

   There must be exactly one public type in the assembly that implements IJobHandler. If this is not the case, then the extension will fail to load. An instance of this type is instantiated.
3. The assembly is checked for certain required assembly attributes. Specifically,

   1. **ApiVersion**: An attribute of type Autodesk.Connectivity.Extensibility.Framework.ApiVersionAttribute which specifies the version of the API that this extension was written for. If the version does match the current version of the Vault API, the extension will fail to load.
   2. **Company, Description, ProductName:** Attributes from the namespace System.Reflection of types AssemblyCompanyAttribute, AssemblyDescriptionAttribute, AssemblyProductAttribute are required and must not be empty strings. If these do not exist or are empty, the extension will fail to load.
   3. **ExtensionId:** An attribute of type Autodesk.Connectivity.Extensibility.Framework.ExtensionIdAttribute which specifies a unique Id as a string (in Guid form). If this attribute does not exist or is empty, the extension will fail to load.

**Job Handler Configuration**

The Job Handler configuration file is an xml file containing configuration information for the Job Processor. It is located in the same directory as the JobProcessor.exe (usually C:\Program Files\Autodesk\Vault Client <year>\Explorer) and is named JobProcessor.dll.config. The relevant section for configuration of Job Handlers is under configuration\connectivityExplorer\jobHandlers. In this xml section, each jobHandler element represents one Job Handler. The jobHandler xml elements are of the following form:

```
<jobHandler class="jobType" handler="NameOfTypeImplementingIJobHandler"/>
```

Where:

1. the **class** represents the Job Type. When a Job is added to the Job Server queue, the Job Type is specified and this unique string is used to decide which Job Handler will process that Job.
2. the **handler**represents the name of the type within the assembly that implements IJobHandler. This can be specified in various ways. You need to specify a string that when passed to System.Type.GetType(string) (see <http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/w3f99sx1.aspx>) will return the type of the object in your assembly that implements IJobHandler.

Thus, a valid jobHandler element for our sample extension would be:

```
<jobHandler class="jobhandlersample" handler="JobHandlerSample.JobHandlerSample, JobHandlerSample"/>
```

In the JobProcessor.exe.config file, you'll notice that there is already a jobHandler entry for each of Autodesk's built-in Job Handlers. The built-in Job Handlers only get loaded in if there is a jobHandler entry existing for them. The built-in Job Handler dlls are located in the same directory as the JobProcessor.exe.

**Check if Job Handlers are enabled**

The configuration information above is used to associate a Job Type with a specific Job Handler. Once that is done, each Job Handler is asked if it can process it's specific Job Type. The Job Handler answers this question by implementing the interface method IJobHandler.CanProcess. At this time the Job Handler should check if it has everything it needs to be able to process Jobs of its type (for example, some of the dwf creation job handlers check if Inventor is installed).

When you check which Job Types are currently processed by a Job Processor (by using the menu Administation->Job Types...), each entry listed means that a Job Handler for that Job Type loaded successfully. If the entry is checked, it indicates that the Job Handler is enabled (that is, it returned "true" from its IJobHandler.CanProcess implementation). In order to have the Job Processor re-ask a Job Handler if it "can process", the user would need to exit the Job Processor and start it up again.

Once all the Job Handlers have been loaded and queried, the Job Processor is ready to begin pulling jobs of the queue and processing them.

**Sample Job Handler**

Vault SDK contains a sample job handler JobProcessorApiSamples. For more information, click [here](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-F21E7DD6-39E9-473C-84BB-3446BCAFCCC0).

### Customize the Job Types List

# Customize the Job Types List

You can determine which job types are processed by a workstation by editing the Job Processor configuration file: JobProcessor.dll.config.

This file is located in the <install dir>\Autodesk\Vault Client <year>\Explorer\ directory.

1. Navigate to the <install dir>\Autodesk\Vault Client <year>\Explorer\ directory and open the JobProcessor.dll.config file with Notepad.
2. Find the *jobHandlers* section.
3. Comment out the line that contains the handler you do not want the workstation to process. Use <!--handler--> to comment out the line.
4. Save the file and restart the Job Processor. Check the Job Types dialog to verify that the job type no longer appears in the list.

### Configure the Job Check Period

# Configure the Job Check Period

The Job Processor checks the server for a new job every 10 minutes by default. This time can be adjusted by editing the JobProcessor.exe.config file.

1. Navigate to the <install dir>\Autodesk\Vault Client <year>\Explorer\ directory and open the JobProcessor.dll.config file with Notepad.
2. Find the *appSettings* section.
3. Edit the line that has <add key="PeriodInMinutes value="10"/> to the desired time. The time can be set to a fractional value, such as 0.1 for 6 seconds or 1.5 for 90 seconds.

   Note: Setting this value below one minute will impact performance of the overall system. Larger values are recommended.
4. Save the file and restart the Job Processor.

**Parent page:** [Job Server Administration](GUID-41C25A0B-81DC-4E5B-B98B-3EA7B280CD97.htm)


### Configure the Time Limit for Restarting Jobs

# Configure the Time Limit for Restarting Jobs

JobProcessor.exe monitors and controls the Connectivity.JobProcessor.Delegate.Host.exe application, restarting it if it does not complete a single job within a configured amount of time. Time limits can be configured for certain parameters in the JobProcessor.dll.config file.

The parameters are:

* InventorUpdateRevBlockReleasePeriodInMinutes
* InventorDwfPublishReleasePeriodInMinutes
* TrueViewDwfPublishReleasePeriodInMinutes

**Parent page:** [Job Server Administration](GUID-41C25A0B-81DC-4E5B-B98B-3EA7B280CD97.htm)


### Configure Job Processor Use Limits for CAD Services

# Configure Job Processor Use Limits for CAD Services

CAD services (such as Inventor DWF generation or RevBlockUpdates) are restarted after a specified number of uses. Use limits can be configured for certain parameters in the JobProcessor.dll.config file.

The parameters are:

* UpdateRevBlockMigrateLatestINV
* InventorUpdateRevBlockCount
* InventorDwfPublishCount
* TrueViewDwfPublishCount

Note: JobProcessor.exe does not open and close CAD services for each job. Although the initial job still has to load the CAD libraries, each subsequent job will not have to reload the CAD libraries (until a restart is performed).

### Troubleshooting Job Processor

# Troubleshooting Job Processor

Before troubleshooting, see the [Job Processor overview](GUID-DAE28A42-45C3-4501-9BF2-78EE2F42808D.htm):

## Job Processor Components

Job Processor has three main components.

#### Jobs

Tasks submitted to the job queue and completed by Job Processor; these are typically repetitive tasks like property updates or dwf creation.

#### Job Queue

The server-side utility that accepts jobs from Vault Clients and records job execution details.

#### Job Processor

The client side component that polls the job queue for tasks and executes them using the appropriate components.

![](../images/illust-job-processor-components.png)

## Job Processor Process

1. Once Job Processor is started, checks the job queue every 10 minutes (this is configurable).
2. If there is an item in the queue, reserves the next queued jobs, taking priority into account.
3. Downloads the files to the local computer.
4. Opens the files, usually in a “headless” (no user interface) version of the associated product.
5. If necessary, updates the file properties and saves the file as a new version.
6. If a dwf update is needed, Job Processor creates the dwf and uploads to Vault, attaching the dwf to the source file; this does not create a new version.
7. Moves to the next job.

## Job Processor Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I install the Job Processor on a server operating system?

Yes, the Job Processor has limited support on a server operating system.

The following Job types and components are supported on a server operating system.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| *Type* | *Required Application* |
| DWF creations of *ipt, iam, idw, ipn* | Inventor Server |
| DWF creations of *dwg* | DWG TrueView |
| PDF creations of *dwg* | DWG TrueView |
| PDF creations of *idw* | Inventor Server |
| Sync Properties of *ipt, iam, idw, ipn* | Inventor Server |
| Sync Properties of *dwg* | DWG TrueView |
| DXF creations of idw | Inventor Server |
| DXF creation of dwg | DWG TrueView |
| STEP creation of ipt | Inventor Server |
| STEP creation of iam | Inventor Server |

Note:

* Check the system requirements for supported server operating systems.
* Full use of DWG Trueview is not supported on a server operating system.
* Use of a full installation of Inventor is not supported on a server operating system.

### What are the system requirements for Job Processor?

See [System requirements for Vault products](https://www.autodesk.com/support/technical/article/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/System-requirements-for-Autodesk-Vault-products.html).

Also check requirements for each application required to run jobs on the processor.

* [System requirements for Autodesk Inventor products](https://www.autodesk.com/support/technical/article/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/System-requirements-for-Autodesk-Inventor-Products.html)
* [System requirements for Autodesk Revit products](https://www.autodesk.com/support/technical/article/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/System-requirements-for-Autodesk-Revit-products.html)

### Can I install Job Processor on an end-user computer?

Yes, but Autodesk does not recommend this. Job Processor is a Vault Client installation option and can be installed and run on any computer. But as Job Processor runs it will open applications and use system resources. In the case of Inventor, it will create and use temporary project files. For this reason Autodesk recommends installing Job Processor on a dedicated computer.

### Does Job processor use a license?

No, Job Processor doesn't require an Inventor license.

For example, if the Job Processor performs Inventor DWF Publishing (InventorDwfPublishCount), it will start Inventor and perform this type of job a set number of times before it closes Inventor and restarts it. This way it does not start and stop Inventor each time it performs one of these jobs.

See: [Configure Job Processor Use Limits for CAD Services](GUID-41C135C2-C437-45D3-9134-FD94CBDD6781.htm).

### How often does a Job Processor look for jobs?

This is configurable, but by default Job Processor checks for jobs every ten minutes.

### What sort of Jobs does Job Processor execute?

Job Processor is configured by default to create visualization files (DWF) and synchronize properties. It can be configured to update revision tables and sync files with a supported Autodesk cloud drive using Project Sync. It can also be extended to execute any number of custom tasks.

### What sort of Monitoring is recommended?

Job Processor is intended to run silently in the background. Under normal conditions, administrators should review the queue on a daily basis to look for specific failed tasks to be resubmitted, or for poorly performing processors.

See [Monitor Your Job Processor](https://blogs.autodesk.com/vault/2015/09/monitor-your-job-processor/).

### What software does Job Processor use?

* Inventor Server: For DWF creation of Inventor formats
* TrueView: For AutoCAD DWF creation
* Revit: For Revit file DWF creation
* MS Office: For older Office file formats

Custom jobs may need additional applications. See the online help for complete job type requirements.

### How do I rerun a failed job?

Jobs that have failed can be resubmitted through the job queue.

### How do I automate Job Processor?

Job Processor can be set to start automatically as soon as your computer starts. This is done in the Job Processor Settings dialog box. Some administrators set up Job Processor so that it runs jobs at off-peak hours when there are additional licenses available. This is usually done using scheduled tasks and batch files.

### Who should be logged into Job Processor?

The Windows user who has the credentials to run CAD applications on the computer.

A separate Vault user should be created where possible for running jobs with elevated file permissions, because the Job processor user may need to edit released or locked files to update properties.

### Whose name appears on a new file version?

When Job Processor creates a new file version, the Vault user logged into Job Processor at the time is added as the creator.

With revision tables, you can choose to display the file details of the first released version rather than the most recent.

### How long does the software take to process jobs?

This can vary greatly but individual jobs are usually completed in under a minute depending on computer resources, file size and job type; overall time depends on the number of jobs.

To optimize performance, CAD applications are restarted after a set number of jobs. This is configurable.

### Will Job Processor migrate a file to the latest software version?

Yes, if you create a new version of the file, it will be migrated to the software version executing the job.

### What happens if Job Processor does not have the right software?

The job type is disabled, and will not run on that computer. Jobs can be manually disabled or configured using the JobProcessor.dll.config file found at C:\Program Files\Autodesk\Vault Client <year>\Explorer.

### What happens if Job Processor does not have the right software version?

The job fails if the file cannot be opened (for example an Inventor 2017 file in Inventor 2016).

### What Should I do if processing is slow?

If you are running a high volume of jobs and are experiencing reduced performance, try the following:

* Use more than one Job Processor.
* Set up one computer to process sync properties and another to create DWF files.

## Troubleshooting Job Processor

### Corrupt installation

From Windows Control Panel, repair or uninstall and reinstall the software.

Make sure proper licensing is configured

If the processing software requires a license, make sure that it can obtain one.

### Unable to process a file type

Make sure you have the appropriate software for the file format you need to work with.

* Creo process PTC files.
* Other applications process their native formats; these include Revit and SOLIDWORKS.
* The Vault Enterprise Add-In can be configured to process formats such as CATV5Product, IGES, JT, PDF, STEP, Flat Pattern DXF using Publish Jobs.

### Install the latest service packs

Some errors can be fixed by installing the latest service packs for both the Processing Software and the Vault Client.

### Job Processor does not respond

Restart Job Processor. If necessary, stop the process in Task Manager, or restart Windows. If a DWF publish is not working, try opening the same file on Job Processor, and export the DWF to the local disk manually. If problems persist, reinstall or repair the installation.

### Software not registered with Windows

Log into the Job Processor computer, start the software, then close it. Check for any error message displayed and troubleshoot them by searching the internet for more information.

### Insufficient user privileges

The user account used by Job Processor needs to have sufficient privileges to perform the action required of it. For example, if file properties need updating when a file is moved from “Work in Progress” to “Released,” the account must have the privileges needed to edit file properties. Check the lifecycle definitions for that category and the account being used by Job Processor.

### Corrupt file errors

* There may be a problem with the file itself.
* Check that the file can be published manually from the application that originally generated it. The problem could be due to a setting used when publishing.

### Job types not processed

Occasionally, Job Type parameters in Job Processor can be deselected; this might have happened if the processing software became unregistered from the operating system. To check, go to Job Processor > Administration > Job Types and see if the jobs you are expecting to be processed on that computer are selected.

### Steps to take when jobs are not being processed or are receiving errors

* Log into Vault Client and make sure that Job Processor is enabled for the server you are logged into.
* Log into Vault Client and make sure that you can see jobs in the queue.
* Look through the queue for jobs with failed results and identify specific error messages and processors failing.

### Steps to troubleshoot Job Processor

* Log into Job Processor, stop the processor and restart, then see if jobs resume correctly.
* Make sure that there are licenses available for Job Processor by manually logging out and into the Job Processor utility.
* Use Task Manager to manually stop Job Processor processes: JobProcessor.exe and Connectivity.JobProcessor.Delegate.Host.exe. Restart Job Processor.
* Use Task Manager to manually stop any CAD applications being run silently on Job Processor, then resubmit the job.
* Run all CAD applications on Job Processor to make sure there are no problems with the installations.
* Manually complete “create DWF” tasks in Inventor, TrueView or Revit to make sure they complete correctly.
* In Vault Client on the Job Processor computer, try to manually update the view to see if it can create a DWF. (This process bypasses Job Processor.)
* Restart Job Processor to resolve issues with updates, background processes, or crashes.
* Make sure the operating system and any relevant software on the Job Processor computer is up to date with latest service packs and fixes.
* Empty the temporary folder on Job Processor (%temp%).
* Temporarily disable virus and firewall controls to see if the error persists.
* Enable Job Processor on another computer and see if errors continue.
* Log onto the Job Processor computer as a different Windows user to see if Windows-based permissions or user profile corruption is the problem.
* Log onto Job Processor as a different Vault user to see if this relates to Vault user permissions or access.
* Run a software repair on components used to run failed jobs (such as Inventor, TrueView, Revit and so on.)
* Run a software repair on Vault Client.
* If you find that Job Processor stops responding when working with large files, try changing time-out settings in the configuration file.

## View Job Processor Logs

If errors persist despite troubleshooting, refer to this information on error logging and potential fixes.

### Access error details

* AVFS logs: The File Server logs any failed tasks here.
* Job Queue: From any Vault Client connected to AVFS, select Tools > Job Queue to see job details.
* Event Viewer: Job Processor logs all jobs in the Event viewer Application log on the computer. This can be useful when troubleshooting failed or incomplete jobs.
* Process logs: C:\%appdata%\Autodesk\Autodesk Vault Job Processor\JobProcessor.log.

### Enable Verbose Logging

Locate the JobProcessor.dll.config file. For example, for Vault Professional 20xx, by default this is in C:\Program Files\Autodesk\Vault Client <year>\Explorer. This location will be different if you are using a different release of Vault client.

* Copy JobProcessor.exe.config before editing it.
* Open JobProcessor.exe.config in Notepad.
* Find the following section and the text .
* Change the log level from 0 to 1.

```
         <add key="LogLevel" value="0" />
        <add key="InventorUpdateRevBlockReleasePeriodInMinutes" value="10" />
        <add key="InventorDwfPublishReleasePeriodInMinutes" value="10" />
        <add key="TrueViewDwfPublishReleasePeriodInMinutes" value="10" />
    <add key="DataManagement.Common.Logging.ApplicationName" value="JobProcessor" />
    <add key="DataManagement.Common.Logging.Enabled" value="True" />
    <add key="DataManagement.Common.Logging.ServiceMachine" value="." />
    <add key="DataManagement.Common.Logging.LogFile" value="" />
    <add key="DataManagement.Common.Logging.SerializeProperties" value="False" />
    <add key="DataManagement.Common.Logging.Viewer.Path" value="H:\Common\Logging\LoggingBin\MessageViewer\DataManagement.Common.Messaging.Viewer.exe" />
    <add key="DataManagement.Common.Logging.Viewer.AcceptLocalMessageOnly" value="True" />
    <add key="DataManagement.Common.Logging.Viewer.Port" value="8080" />
    <add key="DataManagement.Common.Logging.Viewer.AutoLaunch" value="False" />
```

Once the value has been changed to 1, save the JobProcessor.exe.config file and then restart Job Processor.

When Job Processor processes a new job, information will be inserted in the JobProcessor.log file.

Also, more verbose information will be posted into JobProcessorJobActivity.log.

Review the new information in both new files.

## Error Reference

### "Unknown Error During Publish"

This can have a number of causes. When this happens with specific files, open the affected file manually and try to save to a new file and recreate the failed task (for example, create DWF).

Possible causes:

* Missing references
* Model corruption
* Data not migrated
* Missing links or applications on Job Processor

### "Unable to retrieve File version for id xxxxxxx" or “An error occurred while attempting to retrieve a file.”

This happens when a job is created for a certain file, but the file is removed from Vault (for example, deleted) before the job could be executed.

### "Index (zero-based) must be greater than or equal to zero and less than the size of the argument list."

This can be a result of the DWF attached to the file being updated being locked (for example, checked out or in use). To resolve, try the following:

* Contact the user and tell them to check the file back in, then resubmit the job.
* Log in as Administrator, remove the reservation on the file, then resubmit the job.
* Delete the DWF from the Vault, then resubmit the job (this will lose version history).

### "The new Job Processor service is not responding."

This error occurs if JobProcessor.exe or Connectivity.JobProcessor.Delegate.Host.exe stops responding. You will need to log into the computer and do one of the following:

* Exit Job Processor and restart it; or,
* Kill both processes in Task Manager and restart Job Processor.

### "This file is only available from the following sites which are not accessible at this time:"

This can be caused by an interruption in network connectivity between the ADMS and AVFS servers.

This could also occur if the AVFS computer was restarted or suffered a power outage.

Resubmitting the Job once communication between ADMS and AVFS is restored should resolve the issue.

### "File Locked;"

This Job Processor error can occur if a user tries to execute a task on a file, such as Synchronize Property, but the file is locked to the Job Processor user account.

### "Sync properties not allowed on non-tip versions"

This error indicates that a new version of this file was created before the job could be completed. This can happen if a user changes the state on a file, for example from “work in progress” to “in review.” Administrators can ignore, delete, or filter out this type of error.

### Lack of adequate permissions

There are a number of permission issues that can prevent access to edit a file (object- and state-based security). Recheck user access to specific CAD or visualization files, or log into Job Processor as a user with elevated privileges. Note that Job Processor cannot update locked visualization files.

### Non-Unique Visualization files

If you have “enforce unique file names” enabled and there are existing duplicate visualization files in Vault, Job Processor will not be allowed to check in updated visualization files.

### Login Failed

This can happen if Job Processor cannot access a Vault license (all licenses might be use). In this case users will need to make sure licenses are available and manually log in through the Job Processor client again.

### "User is not of the correct Auth type"

The Job Processor does not have the correct permissions to execute a specific job.

### "A visualization file cannot be generated for a non cad file”

This might occur when a virus scanner is running on the Job Processor computer. Test with the virus scanner disabled, and add Autodesk products to the exceptions list.

### "Retrieving the COM class factory for component with CLSID {C343ED84-A129-11D3-B799-0060B0F159EF} failed due to the following error: 8007045a A dynamic link library (DLL) initialization routine failed. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x8007045A)."

This can occur when checking in an IPT file linked to a DWG. It occurs when the process Connectivity.WindowsService.JobDispath.exe is started before the process Connectivity.JobProcessor.Delegate.Host.exe.

To resolve this, start Vault Client as the first process, update the file view with Job Processor, and add one or more jobs to the Job Queue. Start Job Processor.

### "It looks like an error occurred during the file update. Please open DWG TrueView, Inventor, or Navisworks and try again."

This might occur while running the Job Processor using Task Scheduler to create a PDF and DWF for AutoCAD DWG.

To resolve this issue, perform the following steps:

1. Close all related processes to jobprocessor (jobProcessor.exe, jobProcessor.delegate.host).
2. End task in Task Scheduler.
3. Go to Component Services > Computers > My Computer > DCOM Config > DWG TrueView Drawing Properties, and select the "The interactive user" option on the Identity tab.
4. Remove previous jobs and create new in job queue.
5. Restart computer.

## Appendix

### Batch file to start Job Processor from the command line:

See: [Job Processor Command Line](GUID-2D6ACAFC-7B43-4D0D-8A03-1D2B06F056DA.htm)

```
REM start Job Processor
start JobProcessor.exe
REM prevents Job Processor from processing any more jobs on its queue after finishing its current job
JobProcessor.exe /pause
REM allows Job Processor to continue processing jobs on its queue from a paused state
JobProcessor.exe /resume
REM stops and exits Job Processor after finishing its current job
JobProcessor.exe /stop
```

You can also use command line arguments, in combination with a scheduled task and powershell, to restart JobProcessor.exe every few hours on the VM.

```
# === powershell.ps1 script ===
& "C:\Program Files\Autodesk\Vault Client 20XX\Explorer\JobProcessor.exe" /stop
Wait-Process JobProcessor
& "C:\Program Files\Autodesk\Vault Client 20XX\Explorer\JobProcessor.exe"
# === powershell.ps1 script ===
```

The `/stop` command will finish the current job then exit Job Processor (releasing Inventor's resources).

See this article on how to do this with Vault 2013 Professional: <http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2012/10/job-processor-command-line-tricks.html>.

Note: To verify the Design Representation classification, click Tools > Administration > Vault Settings > Behaviors > Rules. On the Assignment Rules dialog, view the Rule Criteria for Design Representation.

## File Naming

You can affect the output file names by editing the Job Processor configuration file: JobProcessor.exe.config. The following are supported:

* Remove the source file's extension, such as .idw or .dwg, from the file name
* Add a prefix (static text)
* Add a suffix (static text)
* Add a property value
* Add a date property

1. Navigate to the <install dir>\Autodesk\Vault Client <year>\Explorer\ directory and open the JobProcessor.dll.config file with Notepad.

   Important: Create a backup copy of the file before making any changes.
2. Find the "<add key=>" section in the file.
3. Add a line using the format \*<add key="DesignRepresentation.Naming" value=\*.

There are three special keys in the naming:

* `&lt;`\_name\_`&gt;` is replaced by the file name
* `&lt;`\_ext\_`&gt;` is replaced by the file extension
* `&lt;`\_underscore\_`&gt;` is replaced by character "\_"

See the examples for the file, *Flower.idw*, shown below.

Note: The table below displays result for PDF file. Similar results are generated for DXF and STEP file too.

| Key | Result |
| --- | --- |
| <add key="DesignRepresentation.Naming" value="\.(idw)$/&lt;\_name\_&gt;"/> | Flower.pdf |
| <add key="DesignRepresentation.Naming" value="\.(idw)$/Prefix&lt;\_name\_&gt;"/> | PrefixFlower.pdf |
| <add key="DesignRepresentation.Naming" value="\.(idw)$/&lt;\_name\_&gt;Suffix"/> | FlowerSuffix.pdf |
| <add key="DesignRepresentation.Naming" value="\.(idw)$/Prefix&lt;\_name\_&gt;Suffix"/> | PrefixFlowerSuffix.pdf |
| <add key="DesignRepresentation.Naming" value="\.(idw)$/&lt;\_name\_&gt;&lt; \_underscore\_&gt;Suffix"/> | Flower\_Suffix.pdf |
| <add key="DesignRepresentation.Naming" value="\.(idw)$/&lt;\_name\_&gt;.&lt;\_ext\_&gt;"/> | Flower.idw.pdf |
| <add key="DesignRepresentation.Naming" value="\.(idw)$/&lt;\_name\_&gt;&lt;Revision&gt;"/> | FlowerB.pdf where Revision=B |
| <add key="DesignRepresentation.Naming" value="\.(idw)$/&lt;\_name\_ &gt;&lt;Provider&gt;"/> | FlowerAutoCAD.pdf where Provider=AutoCAD |
| <add key="DesignRepresentation.Naming" value="\.(idw)$/&lt;\_name\_ &gt;&lt;DateVersionCreated&gt;"/> <add key="DesignRepresentation.Naming.DateFormat" value="dd-MM-yy"/>  Note: Add both lines. Use dd=day, MM=month, and yy=year to format the date. (MM must be uppercase) | Flower27-10-17.pdf where the Date Version Created is October 27, 2017 |

Note: Some editors automatically convert `&lt;` to `<` and `&gt;` to `>`. This may cause the Job Processor to fail. It is recommended that you use an editor that maintains `&lt;` and `&gt;`, such as Notepad. The line can contain only the "<" at the beginning and the ">" at the end.

You can add only one line for Design.Represenation.Naming, so combine rules as needed, separating each with a slash (`**/**`). For example:

`<add key="DesignRepresentation.Naming" value="\.(dwg)$/&lt;_name_&gt;&lt;Provider&gt; **/**\.(idw)$/&lt;_name_&gt;&lt;Revision&gt;"/>`

Note: To add other property values, such as Provider, Company, etc, look up the System Name/Display Name of the property. For Vault System Properties, use the System Name and for User Defined Properties, use the Display Name.

Note: If you have configured the output file naming, then the existing output file in vault, if any, may not be updated and a new output file will be created with the edited file name. For instance, if you append "Revision" to the output file name, then the output created for a revised drawing file will be a new file in vault. You won't be able to use and update the previous output file.

## Project Sync Administration

# Project Sync Administration

Administrators can configure synchronization settings between Vault and Autodesk cloud drives, and manage mappings.

Note: This feature is available only in Vault Professional. You also need to subscribe to [Autodesk Docs](https://help.autodesk.com/view/DOCS/ENU/?guid=About_Autodesk_Construction_Cloud_Docs) or [Fusion Hub](http://help.autodesk.com/view/FSNT/ENU/?guid=GUID-8C18EED5-0C11-4AD7-89C5-85A81EF8906C) to use Project Sync.

The Project Sync feature provides file and folder synchronization between Vault and supported Autodesk cloud drives. This capability enables Vault users to either automatically or manually synchronize files from a folder in Vault with a folder in a cloud drive. The synchronization can be configured to work in either direction or both directions providing simple and reliable two-way communications between project team members.

The Project Sync utility can be configured to perform synchronization in ways that best suit your needs. A synchronization can occur at a scheduled time each day, at specific time intervals, or on demand. Use the filter options to have even more control over which files are uploaded.

## Bi-Directional Sync

If bi-directional sync is defined for a cloud drive mapping, any changes to the data in the vault are updated to the cloud drive first. After changes have been updated from Vault to the cloud drive, any remaining changes on the cloud drive are updated to Vault.

## Supported Cloud Drives

* [Fusion 360](http://www.autodesk.com/help-fusion-about-enu)
* [Autodesk Docs](https://help.autodesk.com/view/DOCS/ENU/?guid=About_Autodesk_Construction_Cloud_Docs)

To access the Autodesk Docs or Fusion Hub, you must install [Desktop Connector](http://www.autodesk.com/connect-help-about-enu).

Important: Using the Autodesk Docs with Project Sync, we are unable to support the following applications:

* Inventor references/relationship
* Revit references/relationship
* Microstation references/relationship

## Enable the Job Server

Since the Project Sync functionality depends on the Vault Job Processor to pull jobs from the Job Server queue, make sure that the [Job Server](GUID-41C25A0B-81DC-4E5B-B98B-3EA7B280CD97.htm) is enabled.

You must be an administrator in Vault to enable the Job Server.

## Vault Support for Desktop Connector 16.x

Vault now supports Desktop Connector version 16.4 and higher.

Desktop Connector version 16.x introduces many exciting new capabilities. There are some key differences when compared to 15.x versions that should be considered before choosing to install, learn more by referring to [Desktop Connector 16.x FAQ](https://help.autodesk.com/view/CONNECT/ENU/?guid=Version_Comparison_Desktop_Connector).

**Using Desktop Connector v16.4+ with Vault**

If you have previously configured Vault Sync with Desktop Connector v15.x or earlier and plan to [upgrade to Desktop Connector v16.x](https://help.autodesk.com/view/CONNECT/ENU/?guid=Version15x_Version16x_Upgrade), you will need to take action to avoid disruptions in syncing.

The default workspace location has been changed to “C:\users\USERPROFILE\DC” with Desktop Connector v16.x. This change could cause the Job Processor to error on Project Synchronization jobs. An error may also be shown when opening the Project Sync configuration dialog.

To avoid these errors after installing Desktop Connector 16.x, [edit all Cloud Drive mappings](GUID-4782F796-078A-42FC-B6BF-DF49FBF04EB0.htm) (Docs & Fusion) in the Vault Client.

1. Go to Tools > Administration > Vault Settings > Collaborate > Configure.
2. Select a mapping and choose “Edit”.
3. Update the “Cloud Drive folder” to point to the new workspace location. This may automatically get updated upon editing, be sure to click Ok when exiting the dialog.

Important: If you are using multiple Job Processors, all Job Processor machines should be on the same version of Desktop Connector.

**Known Issues or Limitations**

* Inventor workflows with Autodesk Docs require creating a project file using the Desktop Connector’s workspace location. This is only required for those users not using Vault and a Vault Inventor Project file.
* If you are syncing Autodesk Inventor 2024 data, you will need to upgrade to Desktop Connector 16.x. Desktop Connector 15.x does not provide reference support for Autodesk Inventor 2024.

### Fine-Tune Vault Client Performance

# Fine-Tune Vault Client Performance

Certain settings in the Vault client application can affect performance in the client as well as the Vault add-ins.

## Customize the View Command

This is a commonly used setting in the Vault client program. It is used to add information to display grids. Usually, this does not have much additional impact on performance. However, some display fields, such as the thumbnail property, may take a longer to display. Enabling these settings only on an 'as needed' basis can help to improve day-to-day performance.

## Memory

Add-ins for design applications consume additional memory. The amount of memory they consume is typically small, but in certain circumstances, it makes sense to review the memory usage on the client. The most common problems occur when the original client CAD model uses most of the available memory of a computer before introducing a vault into the workflow. Please refer to the Server Memory section for additional instructions on how to review the memory usage on your systems.

## Disk Performance

Like the server, client computers can suffer from disk fragmentation as well. The concept of analyzing disk fragmentation is the same for both clients and servers.

### Fine Tune Vault Server Performance

# Fine Tune Vault Server Performance

Fine-tune a number of factors to get optimal performance from the Autodesk Vault server.

## Operating system

A dedicated server operating system such as Windows server 2016 or Windows Server 2019 is preferable to workstation operating systems.

### Server memory

In order to determine whether the server has enough available memory, some key factors must be considered: the size of your data and the number of users concurrently accessing the Vault server.

**View memory usage**

1. Invoke the Task Manager by right-clicking in the taskbar or pressing CTRL.

   ![](../images/task-manager-performance.png)

   If the Commit Charge Total regularly exceeds the total amount of physical memory, it is likely that many of the programs and processes on the server are using the disk-based swap file excessively. Using the swap file is much slower than using physical memory. Windows uses the swap file for many tasks, so a small amount of swap file usage will not cause any problems.
2. If you suspect that your server has an inadequate amount of memory, check the Commit Charge Total value. Clicking the Processes tab reveals more details on the memory usage of all programs or processes.

   Initial memory usage by Autodesk Vault server.

   1. IIS Web Server process (there may be many of these running).
   2. Autodesk Vault server notification process.
   3. Microsoft®SQL server process.
   4. IIS main Web server process.

   ![](../images/task-manager-processes1.png)

   Memory usage after adding a large Inventor drawing and associated files.

   ![](../images/task-manager-processes2.png)

In general, SQL Server memory grow over time. This is because the database server is using memory as fast cache buffers for frequently used queries. As other programs request memory on the server, SQL Server releases memory as needed. Similarly, the IIS worker process (w3wp.exe in Windows 2003 server) reserves memory for caching as well. When the system starts running low on physical memory, the operating system reclaims some of this memory. In general, unless you have a large site with many users or large models, this will not need to be changed.

## Disk performance

Using multiple disks generally enhances system performance. There are many types of disk technologies available, such as the Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks (RAID). Choosing which type of disk technologies depends on the number of users, vault size, frequency of updates, and so on.

Disk fragmentation can also greatly affect Autodesk Vault server performance. Most Windows editions provide a disk tool that measures how the files on your computer are stored on disk.

Run the disk defragmenter

1. Click Start ► All Programs ► Accessories ► System Tools ► Disk Defragmenter.

   ![](../images/disk-defragmenter-dlg.png)
2. Choose a disk (volume) and click Analyze. Following analysis, a report appears.

   ![](../images/analysis-report-dlg.png)
3. Click the Defragment button.

   ![](../images/disk-defrag-defragmenting-dlg.png)

## Aggressive anti-virus programs

Some types of Anti-virus programs scan data coming from the network and data being written to the file store. If your anti-virus software appears to be engaged for too long on vault operations, such as uploads, adjusting the scanner settings may help.

There is, of course, a trade-off between security and performance. Because of this, performing some test cases and benchmarks on your own data and server is recommended.

## CPU

Faster or multiple CPUs can improve vault performance. Since this option is typically more expensive than the others, consider it after you review the other areas.

### Why Manage Items and BOMs with Vault?

# Why Manage Items and BOMs with Vault?

The top workflow waste that managers want to eliminate is the need manually enter information from one system into another. This is often the case with BOM data in AutoCAD Mechanical. Vault streamlines that workflow by integrating with AutoCAD Mechanical and automatically updating BOM data.

For example, if a change is made to a BOM in AutoCAD Mechanical, the change is automatically captured by Vault. Similarly, if an item update in Vault generates new BOM values, the changes are also shown in the relevant BOMs in AutoCAD Mechanical.

Item and BOM Management Benefits with Vault

With Vault, you can:

* Create and maintain BOMs directly from CAD models, including structure (assemblies), quantity, and position numbers.
* Edit BOMs in Vault by adding and removing rows, ungrouping rows, reordering rows, and modifying positions.
* Release and publish BOM data to ERP Systems
* Synchronize promoted items with latest file versions
* Attach new drawings to an item automatically
* Ensure DWF files are up-to-date for viewing
* Start procurement before the design is complete.

#### Enforce Consistent File and Item Names

# Enforce Consistent File and Item Names

Ensure your data is organized with logical names by incorporating Vault numbering schemes. In addition, Autodesk recommends using a Data Standard sheet to standardize how file data is provided in AutoCAD and the Vault client.

## File Numbering and Data Sheets

Use a default or customized numbering scheme to ensure that all files in a vault are named in a consistent format. This will help with file organization.

Autodesk recommends that you use [Data Standard](http://help.autodesk.com/view/vault/2015/enu/?guid=guid-5030830e-69f8-4a57-abe4-d1d430c58f95) sheets to leverage the numbering scheme capabilities in Vault.

![](../images/dialog-2015r2-new-dlg-ds-cad-new-file.gif)

The Data Standard sheet should be customized to define these behaviors:

* The file name
* Where the file is saved
* If the Vault Check-in dialog is displayed
* Which AutoCAD TitleBlock properties are synchronized with the Data Standard entries.

```
See [Map AutoCAD DWG Properties in Data Standard](http://help.autodesk.com/view/vault/2015/enu/?guid=guid-828ec987-3e70-4132-815a-55646e4f31b7) for more information.
```

These settings ensure that all AutoCAD Mechanical files adhere to the same numbering scheme and are saved in the same location, and that all title block properties are automatically synchronized.

A standardized workflow creates a familiar, reliable path for users to check files into a vault from AutoCAD Mechanical, and it eliminates the risk of user error.

## Item Numbering

When an item is created, the default numbering scheme is used to generate the item number.

Use the out-of-the-box numbering scheme or create your own to reduce user workload and standardize the item numbering process.

For example, if a numbering scheme requires user input, users are immediately prompted to fill in the required values so there is no need to go back and edit the item record later.

**Parent page:** [Key Vault Administration Settings](GUID-2F48F2C5-63DE-4A38-949E-CAFA51382B45.htm)


#### Configure Item Settings

# Configure Item Settings

Make the most of your AutoCAD Mechanical Item and BOM workflows by configuring these settings in Vault.

## Use Validation Options in Item Lifecycles

When setting up [lifecycle state transition](http://help.autodesk.com/view/vault/2015/enu/?guid=guid-b4443a39-a621-4e14-8a11-484efbf3db90) criteria for your items, be sure to take advantage of the automatic validation options available. Validation options are a great way to ensure that items meet certain requirements before changing state.

For example, you can require that items meet these criteria before they can change state:

* Linked items are released
* Children items are not Obsolete
* Children items are released
* Associated item file links are up-to-date
* Associated item file links are released

## Suppress the Associated Items Dialog for a Faster Workflow

By default, when you link an item to an AutoCAD Mechanical file and jump to the item, the Associated Items Dialog displays. This dialog lists all items that are currently linked to the file. Since some files may have many item links (part-references), this list can be quite long.

Autodesk recommends suppressing this dialog in your Vault Options so that you go straight to the newly-linked item in these situations.

## Leverage the Flexible Sub-component Links Feature to Suit Your Design Process

Control the link type for sub-components by configuring whether Primary and Secondary or Standard component links are used during an Assign Item or Update Item event.

#### Prepare Your Title Blocks

# Prepare Your Title Blocks

Follow these best practices for preparing your title blocks for synchronization with Vault.

## Be Consistent with Title Block Names

Use consistent and clear naming conventions with your title blocks. This makes it easier to recognize your title block names in a long list.

## Use Concise Descriptions

Make sure title blocks have concise descriptions. These descriptions will be visible as properties in Vault and can provide a quick way to identify the drawing.

## Use Title Block Properties Instead of Attributes

Autodesk recommends that you use properties with your title blocks instead of attributes. Vault mapping is most reliable with AutoCAD title block properties.

## Know Your Title Block Names

Record the title block names that are used in your drawings. These names must be enabled in Vault before you can map them. The names must match exactly for mappings to succeed.

#### Enable AutoCAD Block Property Values in Vault

# Enable AutoCAD Block Property Values in Vault

Block attributes must be enabled in Vault before you can map them.

## Do Not Extract Attribute Prompts

When enabling your AutoCAD Block Properties in the ADMS Console, Autodesk recommends that you turn off the **Extract attribute prompt when available** check box. AutoCAD Mechanical attribute names are checked only if they are unique, and prompts are not always unique.

### Creating Items and BOMs with AutoCAD Mechanical File Data

# Creating Items and BOMs with AutoCAD Mechanical File Data

Keep these practices in mind when creating items and BOMs with AutoCAD Mechanical data.

## Use Item Versions to View Item Changes

See item versions by selecting View > Show All Item Versions. Item versions can then be viewed on these tabs:

* General Tab
* History Tab
* BOM
* Where Used

## Use the Update Item Command to Automatically Create New Items for New Associated Files

Updating an item linked to an assembly file creates a new item for each new file associated with it. If any drawing files that were originally associated with the CAD files are removed, their association with the item is also removed when the item is updated.

Note: Once a file is saved and checked in using AutoCAD Mechanical it will need to be only opened and checked in from AutoCAD Mechanical to continue to send item data. Saving an AutoCAD Mechanical DWG using AutoCAD or AutoCAD LT will remove any existing item data from the DWG and cause item assignment to fail.

**Parent page:** [Best Practices: AutoCAD Mechanical and Vault (items-and-boms)](GUID-7CD64749-FFC6-49CF-B1B0-CE5378367B82.htm)


### Assigning Items

# Assigning Items

Make the most of the Assign Item command with these best practices.

## Drag-and-Drop or Copy-and-Paste File and Item Links

Use the drag-and-drop or copy-and-paste features to:

* Assign files to items
* Assign an item to another item
* Assign a component to an item

## Create Long Lead BOMs to Start Procurement Before a Design Is Complete

Some components take longer to procure due to complexity, quantity, or availability. Use Assign Item to create a partial BOM so you can start procurement before the design is complete.

## Know Your Links

It is essential to understand how Vault treats different link types so you can make the best decisions for your design process.

| Link Type | Read/Write Properties | Old Link Prevents State Change to Release | Create the Link Automatically | Update Item |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *Primary* | Yes/Yes | Flexible | Yes | Yes |
| *Secondary* | No/Yes | Flexible | Yes | Yes |
| *Standard Component* | No/Yes | Flexible | Yes | No |
| *Automatic Tertiary* | No/Yes | Flexible | Yes | Yes |
| *Primary Sub-component* | Yes/Yes | Flexible | Flexible | Yes |
| *Secondary Sub-component* | No/Yes | Flexible | Flexible | No |
| *Attachment* | No/No | No | No | Yes |

### Updating Items and BOMs with AutoCAD Mechanical File Data

# Updating Items and BOMs with AutoCAD Mechanical File Data

Update Items and BOMs in Vault automatically when you make changes to your file data from AutoCAD Mechanical.

## Synchronize Changes to Title Blocks in AutoCAD Mechanical with Vault

If you make changes to a title block in AutoCAD Mechanical, check the file back in to synchronize the changes with Vault.

Tip: Be sure to select the Keep File Checked Out check box if you plan to continue working on the file.

In addition, entering data directly into your AutoCAD Mechanical BOM and checking the file back in will also synchronize changes with Vault.

**Parent page:** [Best Practices: AutoCAD Mechanical and Vault (items-and-boms)](GUID-7CD64749-FFC6-49CF-B1B0-CE5378367B82.htm)


### Updating AutoCAD Mechanical BOM Data Using Vault

# Updating AutoCAD Mechanical BOM Data Using Vault

## Use Update Item Command to Synchronize Items with Associated Files

Update synchronizes items with the properties of the associated file versions in the vault. An item can be updated even if the associated file has not been changed so as to update any properties that have been globally added since the last update.

Updating an item linked to an assembly file creates a new item for each new file associated with it. If any drawing files that were originally associated with the CAD files are removed, their association with the item is also removed when the item is updated.

## Write Back Item Properties

Use the Synchronize Properties command to write item and BOM properties back to the title blocks in AutoCAD Mechanical.

You can write back data such as the item number, the revision, or the description, amongst other properties.

## Quickly Modify Multiple Title Block Properties with the Property Grid in Vault

A fast way to update title block properties in bulk is to use the [Properties Grid](http://help.autodesk.com/view/vault/2015/enu/?guid=guid-ad7174e2-b36c-40c2-9608-2d7a7965bd40). This workflow is especially useful if you have the drawing already open in AutoCAD Mechanical but want to quickly update all of the Title Block properties.

1. Select the drawing in Vault for which you want to change the property values.
2. Select the properties in the Properties Grid and click Edit.
3. Enter your values for each property selected.
4. Click OK.
5. Return to the open drawing in AutoCAD Mechanical and click Refresh to get the latest values from Vault. The Title Block is automatically updated.

## Add the Row Type Field to Your BOM View

Add the **Row Type** field to your BOM view so you can see if a row was manually created or created by CAD. This makes it easier to see the source of your data and determine which content will be overwritten from the CAD application during an update.

See Customize the BOM View for more information.

## Adjust CAD Position Numbers in Item BOMs to Suit Process Needs

Add [position numbers](http://help.autodesk.com/view/vault/2015/enu/?guid=guid-68d49b60-7f76-4fd5-8a1e-60295400c9f5) for manual BOM rows or modify existing CAD positions for greater control over your downstream processes.

Important: If the BOM row was imported from AutoCAD Mechanical or another CAD application, the position may be overwritten if the values change on the CAD side.

The Position Number field will turn yellow for any duplicate position numbers, making it easier for you to identify conflicts.

### Why Manage iParts and iAssemblies with Vault?

# Why Manage iParts and iAssemblies with Vault?

Vault differentiates between family and member revisions, making data management more precise.

This guide shows you how to:

* Create a consistent workflow for family creation up to item management, including all component family members
* Revise component families and reduce revision efforts to affected members only; in particular how to partially revise dedicated variants of a family
* Leverage and expand Inventor functionality when creating and maintaining component families in a Vault environment
* Incorporate naming conventions of component families to allow full support for rename, move, and copy activities through the lifecycle of a component family.

### Creating Factory Members

# Creating Factory Members

Use these best practices to create factory members.

## iAssembly Workflows

When creating factory members, use the following workflow to avoid assembly updates when opening or placing an iAssembly or iPart.

![](../images/ipart-creatfactoryworkflow.png)

## Handling Part Numbers

Apply file numbering schemes to Factory members to automate part number creation.

**Recommended:** Use Vault Data Standard to apply numbering schemes and enforce user input for certain properties. Administrators can configure Data Standard to reserve a number range for parts.

![](../images/ipart-reservenumbers.png)

This is the best way to standardize the creation process and ensure that related parts are grouped by number.

## Share Numbering Schemes for Items and Files

Optimize data management of related items and files by sharing numbering schemes. Use Data Standard to reserve number ranges.

When creating a new iPart, perform these steps:

1. Go to the Add Member table, copy the file name, and paste it into the Member field.

```
![](../images/ipart-filenamemembername.png)
```

2. Insert rows for additional members as needed.
3. Modify the values for the added member rows.

```
![](../images/ipart-addmembers.png)
```

4. Use Data Standard in Vault to reserve a range of numbers.

```
![](../images/updatinghandlingimage.png)
```

5. Copy the reserved numbers and paste them into the Part Number column in the member table.

```
![](../images/ipart-rangepartnumbersinmembertable.png)
```

6. Right-click on the new members in the Model Browser and select Generate Files.
7. Check the new member files into Vault.

## Avoid Pending Updates in Top Level iAssemblies with These Steps

* Use Bottom Up approach to populate all changes to the top level iAssembly.
* Test your members before releasing.
* Use rebuild all on persistent dirty files.
* Don't Use Administrative override.

### Organizing Factory Members

*[No content available]*


### Releasing Families and Family Members

# Releasing Families and Family Members

Follow these tips to optimize the family and member release process.

## iPart and iAssembly Release Overview

1. Create Family.
2. Check family into Vault. Select the option to keep the family checked out.
3. Synchronize/Update iPart family file properties.
4. Test family.
5. Generate members.
6. Check in Factory and Members.
7. Synchronize member properties in the Vault client.
8. Test members.
9. Release iFactory and Members (see-next-sections-for-more-details).

```
Note: Select direct parents to include members when releasing the factory.
```

## Release iFactory

* Members derive from iFactory.
* iAssembly Factory may contain normal parts/subassemblies as well.
* Check Member option.

![](../images/ipart-release1.png)

## Release Members

* Check member option.

```
![](../images/ipart-release2.png)
```

* Check that all members are up to date before releasing.
  1. Get all latest version of the children.
  2. Open members separately.
  3. Place in empty assembly.
* Use quick-change if updates appear after releasing the members.

**Parent page:** [Best Practices: Manage iParts and iAssemblies with Vault](GUID-3AC6DDCF-A25C-4D92-9A26-04CF1719AB7E.htm)


### Revising and Updating Factory and Member Files

# Revising and Updating Factory and Member Files

Use these best practices to revise and update factory and member files.

## Revise Only Affected Members

1. Change state and check out Factory only.
2. Modify iPart/iAssembly and synchronize properties.
3. Generate Members and remove the read-only setting for iAssembly members.
4. Review changed members in the Vault client. Make sure the Add (+) status modifier is displayed.

```
![](../images/ipart-addmodifier.png)
```

5. Change state on affected members only.
6. Check-in Factory.

```
Members are automatically checked-in.
```

7. Get latest members.
8. Test members.
9. Release factory and members in the Vault client.

## Update Factory

Note: When updating, be sure to follow the tips in [Creating Factory Members](GUID-39D2F2F2-4F7B-4450-8FC4-EF988B30290B.htm).

![](../images/ipart-factoryupdateoverview.png)

**Parent page:** [Best Practices: Manage iParts and iAssemblies with Vault](GUID-3AC6DDCF-A25C-4D92-9A26-04CF1719AB7E.htm)


### Renaming Factory and Members

# Renaming Factory and Members

Use these best practices to rename factory and member files.

## Rename Factory

Name subfolders containing member parts the same name as the Factory file name. This is so that when you rename a factory, the subfolder automatically updates as well.

![](../images/ipart-factory-rename.png)

If the subfolder for member parts is not set to the factory file name, Vault allows you to rename the subfolder. However, once the subfolder is named the same as the Factory file name, you cannot rename the subfolder again.

## Rename Members

Standard and custom members are secure. Manually renaming them can cause issues with Inventor.

![](../images/ipart-memberrenamenotallowed.png)

If a member file needs to be renamed without maintaining the family relationship, use Inventor to break the member's link before renaming the file.

![](../images/ipart-inventorlinkbreakformember.png)

**Parent page:** [Best Practices: Manage iParts and iAssemblies with Vault](GUID-3AC6DDCF-A25C-4D92-9A26-04CF1719AB7E.htm)


### Moving Factory and Members

# Moving Factory and Members

Use these best practices to move iPart Factory, iPart Members, and related folders.

## Moving iPart Factory

Name subfolders containing member parts the same name as the Factory file name. This is so that when you move a factory, the subfolder and members are automatically moved as well.

Now, when you move the factory, you move the complete family.

![](../images/ipart-movefactory.png)

## Moving iPart Members

By default, Vault prevents the move of standard and custom members. Generally, iPart families should be managed as a whole, as described in the above section.

However, if you must move a particular member without moving the entire family, Inventor must break the link first.

![](../images/ipart-inventorlinkbreakformember.png)

## Moving iPart Members Folders

Avoid moving design files into members folders. Vault will display a warning message; this is because if your factory subfolder is set up according to best practices in this topic, when you move a factory, all files in the members folder are moved as well.

**Parent page:** [Best Practices: Manage iParts and iAssemblies with Vault](GUID-3AC6DDCF-A25C-4D92-9A26-04CF1719AB7E.htm)


### Using Copy Design with Factory and Members

# Using Copy Design with Factory and Members

Use these best practices to copy your factory and member files.

The usual design intent of component families is for reuse. Therefore, a copy consuming family members is expected to reuse family members or to replace family members by others. In case you need to copy family member anyway, be aware that Copy Design has to remove the member's link to the family.

## Copying Members in an Assembly

As a best practice, do not copy Factory or Members when copying an Assembly. Doing so will break the links to the factory.

## Copying iPart Factory

Derive a new iPart from an existing iPart Factory with the following workflow. This is essentially performing a Save Copy As.

1. Copy iPart Factory.
2. Edit Factory table.
3. Rename members.
4. Make modifications.
5. Save Factory in up-to-date state.
6. Generate new members.
7. Check-in.

## Copying iAssembly Factory

Use these practices when copying an iAssembly Factory.

Bottom Up Approach

* iParts first
* Nested iAssemblies

Copy iParts Factory separately

* Regenerate members with new file names.

Copy iAssembly

* Replace with new iParts/iAssembly members during Copy Design.
* Regenerate Members with new File Names.

**Parent page:** [Best Practices: Manage iParts and iAssemblies with Vault](GUID-3AC6DDCF-A25C-4D92-9A26-04CF1719AB7E.htm)


### Itemizing and Documenting Member Details

# Itemizing and Documenting Member Details

For part family drawings that require many pages to detail, create multiple sheets and link them to the top-level iFactory rather than the individual iMembers. In other words, start by creating one drawing number with all revision data and the table of represented parts on sheet 1, then provide additional details, such as differences, on the other sheets.

![](../images/ifactoryimembers.png)

For the preceding iPart members illustration, follow these steps to document their details in multiple sheets.

1. Document all iPart members within an IDW drawing or series of drawings linked to the entire iFactory.
2. Include a table of the parameter values that differentiate the iFactory members.
3. Link one or more sheets to the IDW to represent each iPart member as needed.
4. Create an item from any iPart member.

Autodesk does not recommend creating a tabulated IDW from individual iPart members.

**Parent page:** [Best Practices: Manage iParts and iAssemblies with Vault](GUID-3AC6DDCF-A25C-4D92-9A26-04CF1719AB7E.htm)


### Migrate iPart and iAssembly Files

# Migrate iPart and iAssembly Files

Migrate your files in this order to ensure a trouble-free migration.

1. Use Task Scheduler > Migrate folder or project.
2. Migrate your files in this order:
   - iPart Factory
   - iPart Members
   - Parts
   - Standard parts
   - Subassemblies
   - iAssembly Factory (lowest-level-first)
   - iAssembly Members (lowest-level-first)
   - Assemblies
   - Presentations
   - Drawings

# Installation Overview

Learn about how to install the Autodesk Vault Server and Vault client, as well as customize your installation to meet your design needs. You can install Vault for a single site environment or establish a multi-site environment. You can also install supporting components that integrate with Autodesk Vault to further streamline your design experience.

It is important to have a fundamental understanding of Vault before installing and customizing Vault for your particular environment. If you are new to using Vault, see the About Vault section in the online help to learn more about the Vault architecture, Vault Add-ins, and Vault editions.

Review the Vault Requirements

Before installing Autodesk Vault, review the [Installation and System Requirements](https://www.autodesk.com/vault-system) for your Vault edition.

Plan Your Deployment

A Vault implementation can be as simple as installing all components on a single computer, or as complex as installing components on several computers in different locations. The more complex the Implementation, the more information there is to consider. Review [Planning Your Deployment](GUID-590CC16D-0CA4-47A2-AA4E-713B8116DEAC.htm) to help you determine how best to implement Vault for your work environment.

If you are installing Vault Professional, you must install the License Manager.

Follow the steps in [Vault Licensing](GUID-30A964D6-E937-4271-B6AC-C515D9091DEE.htm) to install the License Manager for Vault.

Install the Vault Server

You must install the Vault Server before installing the Vault Client or any supporting components. During the installation process, the installation wizard performs several [Pre-checks](GUID-CCA5719F-4BE6-4BC9-AC46-42DB83D8DB52.htm) to make sure that the system on which the Vault Server is being installed meets the system requirements.

There are three types of server installations:

* **[Quick Start Installation](GUID-E43F824E-1308-4DBC-9C4E-EA142103EB03.htm)** –A step-by-step walkthrough with a default configuration. If this is your first time installing the Vault Server and you will be using a single Vault environment, select this installation path.
* **[Custom Installation](GUID-C16D060C-0785-40FC-A5F7-A636E885D109.htm)** –Provides additional information about customizing your Vault server environment.
* **[Distributed Teams Installation](GUID-3561F6E4-81B2-4C9A-AD73-B74B751F9FDF.htm)** –Provides information about setting up a multi-site or replicated Vault environment.

Select the installation type that suits your work environment and follow the steps to install the Vault Server.

Install the Vault Client

After the Vault Server is installed, you must install the [Vault Client](GUID-C3D45E7C-68FA-4EE5-909D-E6D183F22F6A.htm).

Optional: Install Supporting Components

Vault integrates with additional products to help you optimize your design environment. Refer to [Install Supporting Components](GUID-F84E590B-4483-41D3-B15F-FF4A01E75DCB.htm) for Vault integration options.

### Plan Your Deployment

# Plan Your Deployment

Before you begin your Vault installation, you should prepare for the deployment by examining your environment and gathering data to ensure an optimal installation experience.

A Vault implementation can be as simple as installing all components on a single computer, or as complex as installing components on several computers in different locations. The more complex the implementation, the more information there is to consider. The following sections detail information to consider to make the best decisions for your Vault implementation.

## Number of Users

Knowing the number of users helps prevent access problems and slow response times. For example, if you have more than ten concurrent users, use Windows® Server 2012. For more than 25 users, consider upgrading to the full standard edition or enterprise edition of SQL. Microsoft SQL Express allows only 25 concurrent connections. When implementing Vault for a single user, you can load all the components on a single computer.

## Number of Servers

When determining the number of servers, keep in mind how information flows from the client computer to the Vault server to the SQL server and back. (see-how-vault-works-for-more-information.)

## Server Hardware Specifications

Vault uses Microsoft SQL so it is more processor intensive than memory intensive like some other applications. Avoid loading Vault components on servers that already have a high CPU usage.

## Server Operating Systems

Vault Server can be loaded on several different operating systems. When deciding to use a non-server operating system, consider the limitations.

## Firewalls

Firewalls can block incoming requests. During the Vault Server installation, the server is checked for known firewalls. Firewalls can require that you configure them to allow the Vault Server to communicate correctly. Some system protection software can include firewalls. Check these tools for the existence of firewalls.

## Applications on Servers

Vault can be processor intensive. Loading the Vault Server on a server with other processor intensive applications can cause Vault to run slower than expected.

## Microsoft SQL Express

Autodesk Vault requires a minimum of Microsoft SQL Express. See [Installation Requirements](https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/vault-products/troubleshooting/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/system-requirements-for-autodesk-vault-products.html).

If your Vault implementation requires more capacity than SQL Express, set up the Vault server using the Standard or Enterprise versions of SQL.

If your computer/domain is set up to require strong/complex passwords, you will not be able to use the default SQL SA password used by the Autodesk installer. Visit [SQL Administration Tasks for Autodesk Vault](GUID-6E35739D-CBCC-4211-9051-E451EBE3360C.htm) for information about setting an appropriate SA password. Check with your IT administrator to learn the requirements for a strong/complex password.

Autodesk Vault 2025 installs SQL Express Adv 2017 using the Network Service account for SQL services. SQL Express Adv 2017 cannot be installed on a domain controller under a local service account or a network service account.

For security reasons, Microsoft recommends that you do not install SQL Server on a domain controller. Visit [Hardware and Software Requirements for Installing SQL Server](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms143506.aspx) to learn more.

## SQL Failover Clustering

Autodesk Vault functions in a SQL failover cluster configuration in which it is unaware of the cluster and does not require reconfiguration of Vault if and when a failover occurs. This is known as the AlwaysOn Failover Cluster Instances (fci). More information about this configuration can be found at [Always On Failover Cluster Instances](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms189134.aspx). Before configuring this feature, Windows Server must be configured for [Windows Server Failover Clustering (WSFC) with SQL Server](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh270278(v=sql.130).aspx). When Vault is used within a SQL failover cluster environment, workflows occurring during a failover may be interrupted and require repeating the workflow.​

## Access Frequency

How often the Vault Server is accessed affects the server performance. For example, a Vault implementation with 50 users and one or two users checking out one or two files a day does not tax the server much. Using the same configuration with 35 of the users accessing the vault every 10 minutes will have a greater impact on Vault Server performance since it exceeds the recommended number of concurrent users.

## Network Speed

Although network speed is commonly equated to latency, you should also consider bandwidth and throughput. Network speed is an important factor to consider when trying to get the best performance for your Vault implementation. By running tests to measure your latency, bandwidth, and throughput among all of the servers, you can gain an idea of how fast the connections are. Copy a few large files from one server to another. When performing this test, copy from Server A to Server B and then copy from server B to Server A. Data traveling from one server to another does not always take the same route when traveling back.

## Additional Considerations for Distributed Teams

If you are installing the server components for Vault Professional, you have several options to better support teams distributed across multiple locations. Vault Professional supports Multi-Site replication with a central remote database. Vault Professional also allows a single site to implement Vault with a dedicated database server.

### Multi-Site

Multiple remote sites can be configured to access the same vault data. A site comprises a dedicated Autodesk data management server and a file store. Each site accesses a shared AUTODESKVAULT SQL instance.

### Expanded Architecture

In addition to a traditional multi-site environment configuration, the multi-site architecture can be expanded by using the Autodesk Vault File Server. In this layout, a remote site hosts its filestore locally, similar to a traditional multi-site environment, while directing meta-data traffic to the Autodesk Data Management Server to which it is connected. This configuration can provide considerable performance improvements if the remote site has a poor or slow connection to the SQL server.

### Replication

Replication is the process of copying data from one server to another server usually located in two different physical locations. This process allows the setup of a Vault environment that has two different locations. Users will not have to spend time downloading large CAD files across their Wide Area Network (wan) connection.

The connected workgroup feature in Autodesk Vault Professional supports the use of multiple database servers using Microsoft SQL merge replication technology. This technology allows the replication of the SQL database at multiple locations.

## Supported Language Configurations

### Supported Client Language Configurations

Any client meeting the following criteria can work with any server of any language meeting the server criteria below. Client language and server language do not need to match.

* The Autodesk Vault client is supported on operating systems of the following languages: Brazilian Portuguese, Czech, English, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Russian, Simplified Chinese, Spanish, and Traditional Chinese.
* An English language Vault client is supported on all supported non-English language operating systems.
* A non-English Vault client would only be supported on the respective non-English operating system. If you install a non-English Vault client on an English operating system, the regional settings and the language should be set to the respective non-English language or region for it to work properly.

  For instance, the Spanish Vault Client would only be supported on a Spanish operating system. However, if installed on an English operating system, the regional settings and language should be set to Spanish or region with the Spanish language for it to work properly.
* Vault Basic and Vault Professional are localized into Brazilian Portuguese, Czech, English, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Russian, Simplified Chinese, Spanish, and Traditional Chinese.
* The language of the Autodesk Vault CAD add-in must be the same language as the CAD application.

### Other Client Language Notes

The Vault client does not support runtime language switching.

Vault add-ins do not support the switch of a CAD application's language to a configuration which does not meet the criteria outlined in the section above.

An English version of Autodesk DWG TrueView is included in all Vault client products for all languages except Japanese and French.

### Supported Vault Server Language Configurations

Any server meeting the following criteria can work with any client of any language meeting the client criteria above.

* The Vault Server is supported on operating systems of the following languages: Brazilian Portuguese, Czech, English, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Russian, Simplified Chinese, Spanish, and Traditional Chinese.
* An English language Vault Server is supported on all supported non-English language operating system.
* A non-English Vault Server must match the language of the operating system.
* Any case-insensitive collation and/or language of SQL may be used with any language Vault Server.
* Migrating from one Language of Vault Server to a different language of Vault Server is only supported if it is to or from an English Language Vault Server.

Note:

* Operating system date format differences between the Vault Server and Client can occur if the date format in the locale does not match. Vault does not support mixing locale settings in this way. Vault client and server date\time settings should be the same.
* Mapping Text with Number or Text with Date works well when all clients and the server are in the same language locale. If mixed locales are used, values may convert in a manner that is not intuitive and may produce an undesirable result. Therefore, mapping Text with Number or Text with Date is only recommended when the server and all clients are set up to work in the same locale.
* For property mappings, some datatypes require the same client language.

### Other Vault Server Language Notes

Restoring a backup from a different SQL collation other than the collation currently being used will result in the backup's collation being used.

### Supported Connected Workgroup Server Language Configurations

Any server meeting the above criteria can work with any other server of any language meeting the above criteria.

### Other Replication-Related Language Notes

The publisher's SQL collation/language determines collation/language in a replicated environment regardless of the installed SQL language of subscribers.

Autodesk recommends all SQL installations in a replicated environment be the same language.

Your Authorized Users of the Software Autodesk Vault and Autodesk Vault Professional may access and use a dedicated subscription of Vault or Vault Professional software as appropriately licensed, in a headless manner through a virtual or hosted environment for the sole purpose of automating that Vault product’s functionality for Your sole benefit or as part of Your project, as long as your project is not a software product or service of any kind licensed to a third-party.

Each Job Processor running headless, for the sole purpose of automation, on a machine that is not being used by an authorized user, that Job Processor needs a unique Autodesk ID assigned to that machine.

Each Gateway needs a unique Autodesk ID assigned to a Vault Professional license for the sole purpose of the service. An authorized user of Vault can not use the license assigned to the Gateway.

## License Types

Vault offers three types of licenses: Serial Number, Network and an Autodesk ID.

* **Serial Number –**A serial number license is a stand-alone, or device, license that is tied to the machine on which the Vault applications run.

  It is available with Vault Professional and Vault Office.

  Important: [Activate your single-user (device) subscription license](https://www.autodesk.com/support/download-install/individuals/manage/view-your-product-license-information) prior to running any Vault applications.
* **Network -**A network subscription license is a network license that is tied to the Windows account used to run the Vault applications. Only one license is pulled if the applications which require a license are launched from the same machine with the same windows account.

  The network subscription license is available with Vault Professional and Vault Office.
* **Autodesk ID -** The username/email address and password associated with your Autodesk Account and other Autodesk properties (i.e.-forums). You don't need any serial number, your Autodesk ID is used to activate and authorize Vault.

  Autodesk ID license is available with Vault Professional and Vault Office.

#### Licensing faq

# Licensing faq

Refer to these Frequently Asked Questions (faq) to better understand how the Vault licensing model works, and how it impacts usage and purchasing decisions.

For additional details and information on licensing changes to all Autodesk products, refer to the general installation, activation, and license faq article at [Autodesk Installation Overview and faq](https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/infrastructure-map-server/learn-explore/caas/cloudhelp/cloudhelp/2016/enu/mapserver-help/files/guid-af1120e5-97d4-4296-b051-ecf4ae954ddd-htm.html).

With the shift of licensing to the client from the server, will I still be able to use a license server for multi-user licenses?

Yes - existing software on a maintenance plan, and the new multi-user subscription licenses will leverage a network license component to manage concurrent user license access.

Is the license server still accessed by the Autodesk Vault File Server (avfs) the user logs into?

No - unlike previous versions of Vault, each client configured to use network licensing will now connect to the licensing server directly, similar to other networked Autodesk desktop products. This makes it simpler to track license usage, however you will need to ensure all users can communicate with your license server if it is on a separate machine to avfs.

Will forward compatibility still work with Vault 2016 clients?

Yes - users with the Vault 2016 client and add-ins can connect to the Vault Server and/or Autodesk Vault File Server (avfs). These servers will need to be configured to communicate to the network license server to pull the Vault license on the client’s behalf.

Do I need to be connected to the internet to use Vault?

This depends on the type of subscription you have.

**Single user** subscribers require an internet for both initial download and activation. You are required to connect to the Internet and sign in with an Autodesk Account email address and password upon first launch of subscription software and, in order to keep subscription software active, you must also connect to the internet at least once every 30 days after initial activation.

Note: All users receive a reminder 7 days prior to having to reconnect.

**Maintenance Plan** and **Multi-user** access subscribers however are activated via a network license server and do not have an Internet requirement. An Internet connection may be required to download software installation files.

Will I be able to increase my existing Vault license count once Autodesk introduces a subscription only model?

Yes - additional Vault multi-user subscription or single-user subscription licenses can be purchased as per your business requirements and added to your existing license count.

Am I able to mix multi-user, single user subscription and perpetual license types together, for example, to address all my licensing needs?

Yes - licenses can be combined to increment total license counts as desired.

Can I run Vault as a single user subscription type?

Yes - As of August 1, 2016, for Vault 2017 and-later, you may purchase single user subscription license of Vault Professional.

Are all Vault clients supported as single user subscription?

No - Vault 2016 cannot be run under single-subscriber licensing, as well as the Vault Office Thin and Thick clients, which are available as multiple-user subscriptions only.

What happens if my multi-user or single user subscription entitlement ends?

Please note that all vaulted data continues to be owned by your company regardless of your subscription status. At the end of your subscription, you may access your data in the following ways:

* If you have mistakenly allowed your subscription contract to lapse (please-note-we-do-provide-several-modes-of-notification-regarding-any-license-expiration) and you would like to continue using Vault, simply renew your subscription and continue using Vault after your client has access to a valid license.
* If you have decided you no longer wish to use Vault, you may access data via a utility such as Vault Mirror, which allows you to extract the latest read only versions of files to windows folders, or you may choose to leverage a migration tool to extract Vault database and filestore details and import them into another system.
* If you wish to stop using Vault but require access to your files with the historical detail, you need to maintain a sufficient number of subscriptions to enable user access.

Is borrowing of Vault licenses possible?

Yes - Borrowing of Vault licenses is possible with Vault 2022, however, in certain situations this may result in unexpected errors. If that occurs or if you want to block user(s) from borrowing Vault licenses altogether, refer to the INCLUDE\_BORROW section (under Options File Syntax) of the LicenseAdministration.pdf that can be found under the install directory for Network License Manager. The sample syntax for the options file for blocking users from borrowing Vault licenses may look like this: INCLUDE\_BORROW 86646VLTM\_2018\_0F USER noname​​.

What credentials should be used for automated system processes? For example, the Vault Job Processor.

For each job processor running on a machine that is not being used by an authorized user, assign a unique Autodesk ID and email address to that job processor. The actual name and email address to be used is entirely at your discretion, however, the credentials that could be used for each Job Processor could be as follows:

* First Name: Job
* Last Name: Processor
* Email Address: An email address monitored by the software coordinator

If multiple Job Processors are being used, you would need to use different Autodesk IDs and unique email addresses for each one.

How will the Thin Client for Vault Office (and-later-versions) work with single-user licenses?

The Thin Client for Vault Office 2020 (and-later) does not support single-user licenses.

Autodesk recommends using the Vault mobile app for single-user/standalone Vault Office licenses. The mobile app provides robust features for accessing files on iOS or Android devices.

### Vault Installation Pre-checks

# Vault Installation Pre-checks

Pre-checks are designed to make sure that the environment is ready for the Vault installation. If the system fails a pre-check during the pre-installation process, an error is displayed.

## Which Diagnostics Are Performed?

Before Autodesk Vault Server is installed, a series of diagnostic checks is performed to verify that your operating system environment is compatible with the Autodesk data management framework.

If all the conditions are met, the installation continues without interruption.

If either a warning or an error is encountered, a report of the system tests is displayed indicating which of the conditions have passed successfully, generated a warning, or failed. The report includes the name of each condition that is checked along with a link to help you correct any conditions that have failed. The report is also stored in a log file named setup\_mm-dd-yyyy.log.

Note: The Autodesk Vault server is not installed until all failed test conditions are corrected. If any of the tests fail, you can continue installing other products, but the server will not be installed.

The diagnostic checks can be performed again at any time after the Autodesk Vault server is installed by running the Autodesk Server Diagnostic Tool.

## How Do Warnings and Errors Differ?

The System Tests list indicates which of the pre-installation test conditions have passed successfully, generated a warning, or returned an error.

### Warnings

A warning is a non-critical condition that does not require immediate attention. The warning can be corrected, but it is not necessary for the installation of the server to continue.

### Errors

An error is a critical condition that requires immediate attention. If a test condition returns an error, the installation stops and the System Tests list indicates which of the test conditions returned the error.

The server is not installed until all failed test conditions are corrected. You can continue installing other products, but the server will not be installed.

1. For a failed test, click the link displayed below the error and follow the trouble-shooting suggestions to correct the error

   Note: The IIS Timeout and ASP Status pre-checks are automatically fixed when you click Re-Test in the next step. If you would prefer to fix them manually, click the link displayed below and follow the instructions.
2. Click Re-Test to run the pre-installation test conditions again and verify that the error has been corrected.
3. * If the error has been corrected, click Continue to proceed with the installation.
   * If the error has not been corrected, review the trouble-shooting help topic for another course of action or contact Autodesk support for assistance correcting the error.

     Note: You can only use Auto-fix once for an error. If it does not repair the error, you will have to take care of the issue manually or contact Autodesk support for help.

```
If the errors cannot be resolved at this time, you can click Continue without correcting the errors to proceed with installing the other Autodesk products but without installing the server; or click Cancel to stop the entire installation process.
```

#### Autodesk Vault Instance Existence Check

# Autodesk Vault Instance Existence Check

Checks for the existence of a database named AUTODESKVAULT.

Note: From Vault 2021 release you do not need to use the to AUTODESKVAULT database. You can specify your own during installation. See [Install SQL 2019 Server](sql-administration-tasks-for.htm) for more information.

There are several possible failure conditions for this check:

## Check for AUTODESKVAULT

1. The installer found a Vault database that is incompatible with the current release. The installer cannot upgrade this database to the new release.
2. The installer found an existing vault file store and database files in the installation locations. This may happen if you have uninstalled the Autodesk Data Management framework and have also uninstalled the MSSQL$AUTODESKVAULT database instance, resulting in vault data that is no longer associated with the MSDE database.
3. The installer found a Microsoft SQL Server database instance named AUTODESKVAULT, but the database does not contain Vault data.
4. The sa password is unknown.
5. An AUTODESKVAULT instance was not discovered on the remote location specified for a multi-site environment.
6. The server being installed is part of a Connected Workgroup and has not completed the initial replication.
7. The installer found a Microsoft SQL Server database instance named AUTODESKVAULT, but the database has an unsupported (case-sensitive) collation.

### Condition 1

1. Use the server console that was installed with the existing vault system to back up your vault.
2. Install a newer version of Autodesk Vault that supports migrating the data from the existing version.
3. Use the server console that was installed with the newer version to back up the vault again.
4. Uninstall the newer vault client but not the database.
5. Start this installation again.

### Condition 2

* Back up and then remove the files from the following locations:

  + [install drive]\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL15.AUTODESKVAULT\MSSQL\DATA Note: This location is for Microsoft SQL Server 2012 Express or higher. Database folders are named MSSQL.1, MSSQL.2, and so on. See the Microsoft SQL Server Help for determining which folder contains the Autodesk Vault database.
  + C:\ProgramData\Autodesk\VaultServer\Filestore

  Note: Windows hides these directories by default. Enable "Show Hidden Files and Folders" in Windows Explorer if you have trouble locating these files.

### Condition 3

Note: If you remove the SQL server based on the instructions below, you must cancel the server installation and start it again. Re-running prechecks and continuing with the installation may lead to a failed installation.

1. Uninstall the existing MSSQL$AUTODESKVAULT SQL Server instance.
2. Start this installation again.

### Condition 4

1. Temporarily set the sa password to be empty. Contact the system administrator for more information and assistance in changing the password.
2. Once Autodesk Data Management Server is installed, reset the sa password to the original value. Alternatively, install the Autodesk Data Management Server using the command line with the appropriate flags for specifying the sa password.

### Condition 5

* If you are using a multiple site environment and you are installing a subsequent site, the AUTODESKVAULT instance must exist on the computer specified as hosting the remote SQL instance and Microsoft SQL must be configured for remote access. See [Autodesk Mult-site Compliance check](GUID-12FCB183-10CD-4FA0-B09C-42F30A25F04D.htm) for more information.

### Condition 6

* If you are setting up a Connected Workgroup and installing the Vault server on a subscribing server replication may not be complete. Check the publishing server to see if replication has completed.

### Condition 7

If the installer found a Microsoft SQL Server database instance named AUTODESKVAULT, but the database has an unsupported (case-sensitive) collation, then perform these steps:

1. Cancel the installation.
2. Uninstall the existing MSSQL$AUTODESKVAULT SQL Server instance.
3. Start this installation again.

#### Default Proxy Settings Check

# Default Proxy Settings Check

Checks for an HTTP proxy server.

Clients accessing the Autodesk Data Management Server communicate with the server on port 80. If a client machine connects to the web server through a proxy server, then calls to the Autodesk Data Management Server from any Autodesk client will fail. Make sure that the proxy server is configured to bypass local addresses. This check warns if an HTTP proxy server is found.

Note: If SSL is enabled on the server, the default port is 443.

Change the Proxy Settings

1. On the Start menu, select Internet Options.

   You can also open Internet Options from the Tools menu/button, Control Panel or using Search field on taskbar. For more information, see [4 ways to open Internet Options in Windows 10](https://www.isunshare.com/windows-10/4-ways-to-open-internet-options-in-windows-10.html).
2. In the Internet Options dialog, click the Connections tab.
3. Click LAN Settings.
4. If the "Use a proxy server for your LAN" check box is enabled, turn on the Bypass proxy server for local addresses check box.
5. Click OK.
6. Click OK to close Internet Options.

Note: By bypassing the proxy server for local addresses, all addresses without a period (for-example:-<http://-webserver>) will bypass the proxy and be resolved directly.

If the network continues to connect to the assigned HTTP proxy server, then the HTTP proxy address may contain a period. To keep the HTTP proxy server enabled, do one of the following to bypass it

Configure the HTTP proxy server to use a host name in Internet Options

1. Follow steps 1-4 above.
2. If the Address field is "http:// webserver.domainname.com" or "http:// 10.0.0.1", then change it to "http:// webserver" only.
3. Click OK.
4. Click OK to close Internet Options.

Set up advanced bypass proxy configurations

1. Advanced bypass configurations are addressed in the Microsoft document

For more information, see the Microsoft Knowledge Base article 262981: ["Internet Explorer Uses Proxy Server for Local IP Address Even if the "Bypass Proxy Server for Local Addresses" Option Is Turned On"](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/browsers/internet-explorer-uses-proxy-server-local-ip-address)

### Vault Server Installation

# Vault Server Installation

There are three types of Vault Server installations: the Quick Start Single Site, a Customized Single Site, and a Multi-Site installation. Follow the instructions for your server installation type.

## What Is the Autodesk Vault Server?

The Autodesk Vault server is the database server that works in conjunction with Autodesk Vault clients. The server keeps all design and documentation files in a common, secure, and centralized location and manages access to that data. It provides users with access to their files and maintains information about the status of those files and which users have permission to change and update the files. When changes are made to files, a complete version history of all changes is maintained, providing a convenient mechanism for accessing the latest versions as well as previous versions.

The Autodesk Vault server requires Microsoft Internet Information Services (iis). Before the server is installed, a check is performed to verify the presence of iis.

## What Can I Install with the Vault Server Installation Media?

Use the Vault Server installation media to install any of the following applications and components:

##### SQL Administration Tasks for Autodesk Vault

# SQL Administration Tasks for Autodesk Vault

Learn about SQL Administration tasks that apply to Autodesk Vault.

## Default SQL Server Administrator Account and Password

Microsoft SQL Server creates a default administrator account named **SA**. This account has full administrative privileges as well as ownership of system tables. When Vault installs SQL Server, it will configure the SA account with this default password. As long as you do not change the sa account password, the adms Console will not require you to enter it for commands that require a password.

If the sa account password is changed, you must enter the new password when you perform certain administrative commands which require it, such as attaching vaults.

**SA Account Password Default**

* The default password for the SA account is **AutodeskVault@26200**.

A system administrator can change the default SA password for security reasons. After the password has been changed, some adms Console commands will require the administrator to type in the new password each time these commands are executed. The new password needs to be stored in a secure location for this reason.

Autodesk Vault also creates the Vaultsys SQL user account for SQL transactions. This password can be changed using the SQL Server Management Studio. If a system administrator does change the Vaultsys password, he or she must update the password stored in the adms Console.

If you plan on deploying replication, create a "replication user" on the domain. This is a designated account used to handle replication between workgroups. Autodesk recommends that you use a strong password for this account, one that ideally never expires.

Note: if you are adding Vault Server (adms) sites to a Subscriber/Publisher, the adms Installation will reset the Vaultsys password in the SQL Server with the default. It will have to be changed back to your custom password immediately after the installation otherwise user will not be able to access Vault.

For each adms Console installed, there is a SQL Login user created adms-[Servername] in the SQL Server.

## Microsoft SQL Requirements

For single site requirements and replication requirements, see [Vault System Requirements](http://www.autodesk.com/vault-system).

## Log into SQL Server

If the default sa password for the SQL server has been changed, you must log into the SQL server using the new sa password. If you do not know the sa password, contact your SQL server administrator.

1. Enter the user name for the sa account. The default is sa.
2. Enter the password for the SQL sa account.
3. Click OK.

## Install Microsoft SQL Server Prior to Installing Autodesk Vault Server

Install Microsoft SQL Server Prior to Vault Server.

### Install SQL 2019 Server

1. Start the installation process by selecting New SQL Server stand-alone installation or add features to an existing installation from the installation menu.
2. The installation process installs any necessary prerequisites and begins running the pre-installation checks.

   Note: If there are any errors, take the necessary corrective actions before continuing.
3. During Setup Role, select SQL Server Feature Installation and click Next.
4. In the Feature Selection window, select Database Engine Services and any roles required by the environment. You can also specify the installation location at this point.

   Important: Under Database Engine Services, Autodesk recommends that you enable SQL Server Replication, even if you do not immediately plan on deploying a replication environment. Enabling this does not impact a single site installation, and makes it easier to move to a replicated deployment later on if you choose to. Autodesk also recommends enabling Management Tools and the SQL Client Connectivity SDK.

   Note: Management Tools-Basic is available in the Express version of SQL Server.
5. Click Next.
6. In the Instance Configuration window, select Named instance and enter the name. You can use "AutodeskVault", for example, or specify your own instance name.

   ![](../images/screenshot-sql-2012-instanceconfiguration.png)
7. Click Next.
8. In the Server Configuration window, select the Service Accounts tab.

   * Specify the NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE account for the SQL Server Database Engine. The local system account is also acceptable to use. If you plan to perform backups and restores to remote locations, specify a Domain User account. Set the Startup Type to Automatic.

     ![](../images/screenshot-sql-2012-serverconfiguration.png)
9. Click Next.
10. In the Database Engine Configuration window, select the Server Configuration Tab and perform the following steps:

    1. Select Mixed Mode authentication and set the SA password. The default password used during a default installation for the SA account is AutodeskVault@26200.
    2. Add the local administrator account (or-desired-account) as a SQL Server administrator. Only Windows users entered in this dialog have full rights when logging into the SQL server. All other Windows logins are treated as guest accounts.

    ![](../images/screenshot-sql-2012-databaseengineconfiguration.png)
11. Click Next.
12. Verify the installation options chosen and Install. Once the installer is finished, it can be closed.
13. Download and install applicable service packs and hot fixes from Microsoft's web site if needed.

### Reconfigure SQL Logins

If you don't have a domain password policy, you can skip this section. If your domain has a password policy configured, use a password that complies with the policy. After the installation is complete, reset the sa password to AutodeskVault@26200 and uncheck the Enforce password policy check box. It is also necessary to create a SQL login account named VaultSys.

Create a SQL login account

1. Open the Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio.
2. Expand the Security -> Logins folder.
3. Right-click on the Logins folder and select New Login.
4. Type VaultSys for the login name.
5. Select SQL Server Authentication.
6. Type SuperMan769400006! as the password.
7. Uncheck the box for Enforce password policy.

   ![](../images/enforce-password.png)

8. Select the Server Roles page.
9. Check the boxes next to the following roles:
   * dbcreator
   * public
   * setupadmin
10. Click OK to create the account.

## Enable Full Text Search

You can enable to include the full text search during the SQL Server 2019 installation:

1. In the Installation Type tab, select Add features to an existing instance of SQL Server 2019, and click Next.
2. In the Feature Selection tab, select Full-text and Semantic Extractions for Search. Click Next.

## Configure Microsoft SQL Server for Multi-Site Support (vault-professional-only)

If the installation is unable to find an installed version of Microsoft SQL, Autodesk Vault Server installs Microsoft SQL 2019 Express. You can install Microsoft SQL 2019 Standard or Enterprise Edition before installing the Vault server so that you do not have to perform the upgrade at a later time.

Note: This installation process possibly requires the server to reboot multiple times. Please be sure that you are able to perform the necessary reboots. Also, if you use a custom password for the SQL SA account, specify this password during the installation of the Vault server.

### Configure Remote SQL

Vault Professional allows the Vault environment to be configured to use a remote SQL database. This database resides on a dedicated server which a single site can use to increase performance. Alternatively, it can be used for a multi-site replicated Vault environment.

Note: The following steps are detailed steps for setting up remote access on SQL 2019.

1. On the computer on which SQL is installed, click Start ►Programs►Microsoft® SQL Server [year]►Configuration Tools►SQL Server Configuration Manager.
2. In the SQL Server Configuration Manager dialog box, expand SQL Server Network Configuration and then select Protocols for autodeskvault.
3. Right-click TCP/IP in the protocols list and then select Enable.
4. Close SQL Server Configuration Manager.

### Create Shared Network Folders

In a multi-site environment, one site can host the autodeskvault SQL instance. The additional sites access that SQL instance remotely, or all sites can access the same SQL instance remotely. Before configuring the additional sites to access the SQL instance, a shared network folder must be created.

The shared network folder is required as a transition area between the SQL instance and the Autodesk Vault server. The shared network folder can be located on any computer that is accessible by both the data management server and SQL. The space requirement for the shared folder is equal to the total of all database files.

If you are planning on using replication, create a shared folder for database replication and another for file store replication. Give them descriptive names such as ReplicationShare and MultisiteShare.

Give full access to shared folders for these user accounts:

* The account under which the Autodesk Vault server runs
* The account under which the SQL instance operates
* The SQL Server Agent

1. Choose a network location and create a folder.
2. Right-click the new folder and then select Sharing and Security.

# Install the Autodesk Vault Server

After you [install SQL](GUID-6E35739D-CBCC-4211-9051-E451EBE3360C.htm), you must configure [Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS)](Microsoft-Internet-Information.htm) to work with the Vault Server.

After all roles are configured, you can begin installing Vault Server.

The Vault Server communicates using port 80. Some installed software running on port 80 can cause conflicts with Autodesk Vault communication. To avoid conflicts when installing the Vault Server, configure the server to use an open port between 1 and 65535.

When installing the Vault Server on a machine that uses a custom default web site and port 80, follow one of these steps:

* Change the port of the default web site to another number and restart the server installation.
* Remove the default web site and restart the server installation.

If you are planning to use Windows authentication within Vault Professional when using Windows Server Operating Systems, the Windows Authentication service for IIS must be installed.

Select your operating system from the list below to proceed with the IIS configuration and Vault Server installation.

Note: If you are installing Autodesk Vault for the first time and do not expect to customize your installation, refer to the [Quick Start Installation](GUID-E43F824E-1308-4DBC-9C4E-EA142103EB03.htm) section.

# Microsoft Internet Information Services (iis) and Vault

Learn about how Vault works with iis.

When a user requests a file from the vault using one of the client applications, the request is sent to the vault server where it is handled by iis and the MSSQLSERVER Service. iis authenticates the user and handles the connection to the file store, using the service's logon account to gain access to the file store folders and files. By default, the service uses the LocalSystem virtual account. You can specify which account the service uses for additional security.

**View service settings in the Services Manager:**

* From the Control Panel, select Administrative Tools > Services, and then locate iis Admin in the list of services.

**Server Status**

The server status displays whether or not the service is started. The service should, in most cases, be started, but it doesn't have to be for the vault to operate. iis, if not already started, starts the first time a client connects to it.

**Startup Type**

The iis service can be set to start manually, automatically, or disabled. The service should, in most cases, be set to Automatic. If it is set to Manual, the service starts when the first client connection is made. We recommend that it is set to Automatic.

**Log on As**

Use this setting to specify a user which the vault uses for all network authentication. The default setting, Local System Account, works under most conditions.

You can specify a specific user to lock down the file store. By setting a particular user, and then subsequently limiting the access to the file store to only that user, you provide a more secure environment preventing users from unauthorized access to the vault.

See your operating system documentation for more information.

**Connection Failures**

If you no longer can make a connection to the server, you can restart the actual service or the entire computer.

Note: iis needs to be restarted after you restart the SQL Server service.

## Stop iis

1. Click Windows Start > Run.
2. In the command window, enter: iisreset /stop

Note: Clicking Stop in the iis Manager does not disconnect the database connections.

## Restart iis

1. Click Windows Start > Run.
2. In the command window, enter: iisreset /start

If the server console is still reporting that the vault is currently in use, the administrator can restart the database.

1. Click Windows Start > Programs > Administrative Tools > Services.
2. Restart the MSSQL$AUTODESKVAULT service.

**Important:** If the database is a SQL Server that has non-Vault uses, it is not recommended that you restart the SQL Server.

##### Configure to Use Vault on a Machine Which is Using a Proxy Server

# Configure to Use Vault on a Machine Which is Using a Proxy Server

If a client machine connects to the Web server through a proxy server, all calls to the Autodesk Data Management Server from any Autodesk client fail. To have a successful Autodesk Client/Server communication, bypass the proxy server.

Change the proxy settings in Internet Explorer.

1. Open Internet Explorer.
2. On the Tools menu, select Internet Options.
3. Select the Connections tab.
4. Click LAN Settings.
5. If the "Use a proxy server for your LAN" check box is enabled, turn on the "Bypass proxy server for local addresses" check box.
6. Click the Advanced button next to the Port field.
7. In the Proxy Setting dialog box, add the server name and IP address into the Exceptions field.
8. Click OK.
9. Click OK.
10. Click OK to close Internet Options.

All addresses without a period, for example: <http://webserver>, bypass the proxy and resolve directly.

If Internet Explorer continues to connect to the assigned HTTP proxy server, then the HTTP proxy address can contain a period. If this situation happens, configure the proxy server to use a host name.

Configure the proxy server to use a host name

1. Follow steps 1-5 in the previous section to change the proxy settings in Internet Explorer.
2. If the "Address" field is "<http://webserver.domainname.com""or> "<http://10.0.0.1">, then change it to "<http://webserver"> only.
3. Click OK, and close Internet Explorer Options.

##### Configure the Vault Server to Use a Fully Qualified Domain Name

# Configure the Vault Server to Use a Fully Qualified Domain Name

Vault Server can be configured to allow remote connections over the internet using a Fully Qualified Domain Name (fqdn).

1. Create a DNS "A" or host record for your current fqdn with your ISP.
2. On your network router, enter a route in the NAT table that routes the external IP address and port 80 to the Vault server internal IP address and port 80.
3. If you have an internal DNS server, add an "A" or host record that maps the fqdn to the internal IP address of the Vault server.
4. If you don't have an internal DNS server, on the Vault server navigate to C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc in Windows Explorer.
5. Open the Hosts file with Notepad and add a new line mapping the fqdn to the internal IP address of the Vault server.

Note: Additional settings may be required for your router or firewall. Check with your IT department for the necessary changes.

#### Distributed Teams Installation

# Distributed Teams Installation

Autodesk Vault Professional supports distributed team environments.

You can replicate vaults and enforce data control with workgroups. Refer to the steps in this section for setting up a multi-site environment.

### Additional Considerations for Distributed Teams

If you are installing the server components for Vault Professional, you have several options to better support teams distributed across multiple locations. Vault Professional supports Multi-Site replication with a central remote database. Vault Professional also allows a single site to implement Vault with a dedicated database server.

#### Multi-Site

Multiple remote sites can be configured to access the same vault data. A site comprises a dedicated Autodesk data management server and a file store. Each site accesses a shared AUTODESKVAULT SQL instance.

#### Expanded Architecture

In addition to a traditional multi-site environment configuration, the multi-site architecture can be expanded by using the Autodesk Vault File Server. In this layout, a remote site hosts its filestore locally, similar to a traditional multi-site environment, while directing meta-data traffic to the Autodesk Data Management Server to which it is connected. This configuration can provide considerable performance improvements if the remote site has a poor or slow connection to the SQL server.

#### Replication

Replication is the process of copying data from one server to another server usually located in two different physical locations. This process allows the setup of a Vault environment that has two different locations. Users will not have to spend time downloading large CAD files across their Wide Area Network (wan) connection.

The connected workgroup feature in Autodesk Vault Professional supports the use of multiple database servers using Microsoft SQL merge replication technology. This technology allows the replication of the SQL database at multiple locations.

## Distributed Teams Installation Steps

Follow the steps in this section to perform a distributed teams installation. Refer to [Customize the Autodesk Vault Client Installation](GUID-EB9B3AB4-1A7D-4A68-826E-DE56B6E35838.htm) after you are done configuring your Vault Server installation.

##### Decide on a Local or Remote SQL Database

# Decide on a Local or Remote SQL Database

Use the details in this topic to determine whether a local or remote SQL database is right for your design environment.

Note: The remote database configuration is available in Autodesk Vault Professional.

Before you install the server:

* Review the [Deployment Planning](GUID-590CC16D-0CA4-47A2-AA4E-713B8116DEAC.htm) section.
* Review [How do I upgrade from a previous version of the Autodesk Vault Server?](GUID-F7C93287-98E9-4950-93A0-E7A3BC96181E.htm) if necessary.
* If IIS is not installed on the computer that will host the server, you must [install IIS](GUID-540AAC51-2555-4E56-BBAC-870C49FB185B.htm) before you install the server.
* Determine if you are using a local SQL database or connecting to a remote SQL database.

## Use a local or remote SQL database?

Local SQL Database

It is now possible to specify the instance name both during installation and the creation of replicated workgroups

By default, the server installer is configured to use a local database. If a compatible local SQL instance named 'AUTODESKVAULT' is detected, the server connects to the existing database. You are prompted to migrate the existing database once the installation is complete. If a local SQL instance named 'AUTODESKVAULT' is not detected or if the local instance is not compatible, you must install Microsoft SQL Express before continuing the installation. See the [Vault System Requirements](https://www.autodesk.com/vault-system) for the proper Microsoft SQL Express version.

Remote SQL Database

Reasons to use the remote SQL database configuration:

* Performance improvements for single site environments.
* Separation of services or components during installation or deployment.

  Note: For example, when you need to separate your Vault components for scaling and performance, including for replication.

Important: When using a remote SQL database, the SQL server must be on the same LAN as the Vault Server.

## Use a Local Database

If a compatible local SQL database is detected, the name of the database instance is displayed. The installer automatically connects to an existing local database. You are prompted to migrate the data once the installation is complete. If no compatible SQL database was detected or if there is no local database and you are not connecting to a remote SQL database, use the following procedure to install a local SQL database.

Note: If a database is detected that is not compatible with the new version of the server, the existing database must be removed before the server can be installed.

Configure the Local SQL Database

1. If you are installing Vault Professional, select the type of license server model you are using.

   Note: For more information, see [Licensing](GUID-30A964D6-E937-4271-B6AC-C515D9091DEE.htm).
2. Enter the server name of the computer running the Autodesk License Manager.
3. Click Next to go to Configure&Install page.
4. The server is managed and maintained using the server console application. By default, the server console is installed in C:\Program Files\Autodesk\ADMS [Edition] [Year], depending on which data management solution you are installing. Click Browse to change the default installation location.
5. Select the Vault product and unfold its configuration page.
6. Select Local database.
7. If an SQL instance called "AutodeskVault" exists, it's used by default. If there is an SQL instance with another name , you can select an existing one or to create a new instance.
8. Click Browse to select the installation location for Microsoft SQL Server.
9. By default, the database is installed in the same location as Microsoft SQL Server. Click Browse to change the location for the SQL database.

## Use a Remote database

Note: The remote database configuration is available forAutodesk Vault Professional only.

When setting up a second site in a multi-site environment using a remote SQL database, a remote SQL instance named 'AUTODESKVAULT' must be available.

1. In the Server configuration page, select Remote database.
2. Enter the name of the computer containing the SQL instance to which to connect or click Browse to locate the computer on the network.
3. If desired, create a new SQL instance name. Specify the SQL instance name in the edit field. Blick Browse to select the installation location for Microsoft SQL Server, and a location of the SQL database.
4. When using a remote SQL instance, a shared network folder is required as a transition area between the SQL instance and the Autodesk Data Management Server. The shared network folder can be located on the same computer as the SQL instance or on a different computer and must be accessible by both the data management server and SQL. The space requirement for the shared folder is equal to the total of all database files. Choose a location with sufficient space and performance. Enter the UNC path to the shared network folder or click Browse to locate the shared folder on the network. Note: Both the user account under which the Autodesk Vault Server is running as well as the user account under which the SQL instance is operating need read/write access to the shared network folder.
5. The server is managed and maintained using the server console application. By default, the server console is installed in C:\Program Files\Autodesk\ADMS [Edition] [Year], depending on which data management solution you are installing. Click Browse to change the default installation location.
6. Before installation, a series of system checks are performed to verify that the computer is configured properly for a successful server installation. The system tests return warnings or failures. The results of the tests are displayed in an interactive report. The report interface can be displayed:
   * Always show interactive interface
   * Show interactive interface only for failures
   * Show interactive interface only for failures or warningsBy default, Show interactive interface only for failures or warnings is selected. Select a mode from the drop-down list.
7. By default, the SQL sa account is used. You can specify a password for the SQL sa account or use the password set up by default. Turn off the Use default SQL user ID and password check box. Enter your SQL administrator user ID and password.
8. The Autodesk Vault server requires a Windows user account. During installation, an account is created by default. To specify a new user ID and password, turn off the Use default Windows user name and password check box. Enter a Windows account user name and password for the account.
9. Fold configuration page to return to the Configure&Install page.
10. On the Configure&Install page, click Install.

### Account credentials

The Autodesk data management server requires a Microsoft SQL administrator account as well as an active Windows user account.

**SQL credentials**

When the data management server is installed, a SQL administrator account is required. If you are using an existing Microsoft SQL Server installation and you have an existing sa account and password, you can use the password for the existing SQL administrator account:

* User ID: sa
* Password: AutodeskVault@26200

Note: You cannot change the user ID for the SQL credentials.

1. From the Configure&Install page, click Vault product to unfold its configuration page.
2. Turn off the Use default SQL user ID and password check box.
3. Enter the password for the existing sa account.
4. Confirm the password.

**Windows credentials**

A default Windows user account is created during installation:

* User ID: AutodeskVault
* Password: Au1oDeSKvAluT@26200

1. From the Configure&Install page, click Vault product to unfold its configuration page.
2. Turn off the Use default Windows user name and password check box.
3. Enter the user name for the Windows user account.
4. Enter the password for the Windows user account.
5. Confirm the password.

### Upgrade from a previous version of Vault

Before upgrading to a new version of the Autodesk Vault server. Use the ADMS Console to back up all vault and library data.

Note: If you upgrade from a compatible version of Vault, the installation attempts to upgrade your Vault without uninstalling your current Vault server.

* Migrating from Vault 2016 product or Vault 2017 product can be done automatically during the installation of the equivalent Vault 2018 Edition.
* Upgrading the current release Vault Server to Vault Professional can be done automatically.
* Migrating from older versions of Vault will require upgrading to the Vault [Edition] before installing the current release Vault Server.
* Use the Autodesk Installer to install the new version of the data management server. If a compatible database is detected during installation, you are prompted to migrate the database to work with the new version of the server after installation is complete.

Note: If you are upgrading to a new version of the Autodesk Vault server, do not remove the SQL instance or file store. These two components comprise all of the library and vault data on the server. If detected during installation, you are prompted to migrate the data once installation is complete. Removing these components will result in loss of any data that has not been backed up using ADMS Console

Refer to [the Vault Upgrade Guide](GUID-77487172-0582-4912-83B1-2E4847716AE0.htm) for more information.

### Existing databases

If an existing database is detected on the server, you are reminded once installation concludes, to migrate the database.

1. Select Start the server console now and then click OK to launch the server console and migrate the existing database.
2. Select Run the server console at a later time and then click OK to conclude the installation without launching the server console. The first time you launch the server console, you will be prompted to migrate the existing database.

Important: The existing database is not compatible with the new server until the data is migrated.

### Supporting components

Once all the installation conditions are met, any missing supporting components are installed. The components that are installed depend on which components are already installed on the server computer. If the SQL server has not yet been installed on the server, it is installed now.

##### Install the Vault File Server

# Install the Vault File Server

The Vault File Server is a simple file store management system that allows you to move and configure a file store.

Sometimes in multi-site environments a latency can occur when the Autodesk Data Management Server (adms) communicates with SQL. To reduce this latency, the File Server talks directly to the adms instead. Similarly, the Vault client(s) communicate directly with the adms for metadata and the File Server for file upload/download events, reducing the time it takes to update the file store.

Important: The File Server machine must be able to access the machine where the adms Console is installed.

Note: Although the File Server supports a multi-site environment, all file replication must be scheduled from the adms Console.

* Download and install the Vault File Server.
* Basic File Server Configuration Settings.
* Enable a Vault with the File Server Console.

##### What is a Multiple Site Environment

# What is a Multiple Site Environment

The multiple site environment allows users to design products across multiple locations as if all the users were in one location. There are two different methods to accommodate this functionality.

The first method is to centralize the database for all sites. The database for Vault can sit on a separate server as illustrated here.

![](../images/multi-site2.png)

The second method is to set up a main site with the database and main file store located on the same server. The main site has the most users and is where the most design work is done.

![](../images/multi-site.png)

In these environments, users open data files such as AutoCAD drawings, Inventor Assemblies, or Microsoft Office documents from their local file Store. All metadata is read from and written to a central database so that users can open large files much faster than if they copy them across the Wide Area Network (wan)

Note: Setting up the main site first and then accessing the main site remotely provides satisfactory performance for some users. We recommend that you set up the main site and then expand to a multiple site.

## Is a Multi-Site Environment Right for You?

A multiple site environment setup is more complicated than a single server environment. Consider several factors when deciding if you want to set up a multiple site environment:

* Network reliability.
* Network latency and Bandwidth between sites. (should-be-low-latency-and-high-bandwidth.)
* Are you using the [Autodesk Vault File Server](GUID-DD9EB83E-30D8-4476-BD5E-984346440CE9.htm) as part of your environment?
* Number of remote sites.
* Number of users per site.
* Size and number of files to replicate per day/per hour.
* Estimated number of concurrent users.

## Enable or Disable a Vault for a Multi-Site Environment

Note: This feature is available in Autodesk Vault Professional.

**Enable a Vault**

To make a vault accessible to other sites, it must be enabled. When a vault is enabled, it is available to all sites in a multi-site environment. Only vaults at the site from which the server console is running can be enabled.

1. In the navigation pane, expand the Workgroups node.
2. Select the site to work with.
3. Select a vault located on the current site from the list.
4. Right-click on the vault name and then select Vault Enabled.
5. If the file store path for the selected vault is not set or is invalid, you are prompted to specify the file store path for the selected vault. Specify the location of the file store, and then click OK.
6. You are prompted to select whether the vault data is synchronized now or at the next scheduled replication. By default, replication is set for 12:00 AM (midnight) each weekday.

**Disable a Vault**

To restrict any other site from accessing a vault, it must be disabled. When a vault is disabled, it is no longer available to any other site in a multi-site environment. A disabled vault is available only to the site where the vault is located. Only vaults at the site from which the server console is running can be disabled.

1. In the navigation pane, select Sites.
2. Select the line containing the current site and the vault to enable at this site.
3. Right-click on the vault name and then turn off Vault Enabled.

## View Site Details

1. On the Windows Start menu, click Programs ► Autodesk ► Autodesk Data Management ► Autodesk data management server console.
2. Log into the Autodesk Data Management Server console.
3. In the navigation pane, select Workgroups.
4. Select the Site that you want to manage.

   Each site is listed along with a summary of site statistics including:

   * Server Name
   * Description
   * Location of File Store
   * Vault Name
   * Vault Status
   * Replication Type
   * Last Replication
   * Next Replication
   * Site Status

##### Multi-Site Replication

# Multi-Site Replication

This section addresses topics specifically related to the unique environments associated with replicating data to multiple work sites.

## When Should You Use Replication?

Usually a Vault deployment begins as a single-site installation. From there, your organization might decide to expand its infrastructure as needed to meet higher demand.

* **Phase 1**: Install Vault on a single site; this is usually adequate for an organization located in one physical office.
* **Phase 2**: Move to a multi-site Vault deployment, using one SQL server; this is appropriate for an organization with multiple physical offices. Replication at this point might not be needed, as long as performance is satisfactory.
* **Phase 3**: Move from a regular multi-site deployment to a replication deployment with multiple SQL servers in different locations. This would mean upgrading a remote site to a "subscriber" site, with the main, central Vault site being the "publisher" site. Use this strategy to overcome performance impediments caused by sharing data across multiple physical locations; for example, remote offices in two or more different cities.

For large organizations, Autodesk recommends first trying a regular multi-site deployment. If performance is not satisfactory, then you can migrate to a replication deployment.

## Migrate from a Multi-Site Deployment to Replication

Once you have determined that you need to set up replication to handle Vault data volume, follow these steps to enable replication. This describes the steps to take on a central Vault server (the-publisher) and a remote site (a subscriber).

1. On the subscriber (remote) site, uninstall the ADMS Console.

   You will reinstall this later once replication has been enabled.
2. On the subscriber site, install SQL server, either on a dedicated computer or on one that will be shared with the subscriber ADMS Console.
3. On the-publisher site, make sure that replication is enabled on the SQL Server.

   If it is not, you can enable it by running the SQL Server installation program and selecting Feature Selection > Instance Features > Database Engine Services > SQL Server Replication.
4. On the-publisher site, open the ADMS Console and enable workgroup replication.
5. On the-publisher site, in the ADMS Console, add the subscriber workgroup.
6. On the-publisher site, verify that SQL Server is able to replicate data to the newly installed subscriber SQL Server.

   Important: You must do this before reinstalling the ADMS Console in the next step, otherwise Vault replication will not work.
7. Reinstall the ADMS Console on the subscriber site and have it point to the subscriber SQL Server that is also installed there.

## Scalability of File Store Replication

Replication uses a single database for all sites and replicates the file store to each location. This architecture has distinct advantages in ease of implementation, end user experience and the instantaneous nature of the information availability. This architecture is not suited to sites that are distributed over great distances (such-as-between-continents) or poor networks.

**Introduction to Content Center with Replicated File Store**

Autodesk Inventor Standard Content is delivered in the form of library databases that are hosted by the Autodesk Vault Server. Users access these library databases through Inventor to automatically create selected library components as Inventor part files. Once instanced these components are stored in a folder defined by the Inventor project file. When the assembly is then checked into Vault, the instanced Content Center components are also checked into Vault.

In a Replicated Autodesk Vault environment we can tune the performance of Content Center by altering the configuration of the Inventor project file.

**Assumptions**

The following examples assume all software including the Content has been installed. These examples also assume the reader has a functional understanding of how Content is instantiated and referenced. If required please reference the Content Center help.

The diagrams show the SQL server as a separate computer for clarity. SQL Server may be on a separate computer or on the Autodesk Vault Server, either case is supported and has no impact on the workflows detailed in this document.

## Desktop Content Center Folder

The default configuration when using Inventor is for each client to have a Desktop Content Center folder.

Advantages:

* Suitable for assemblies that have a high volume of Content Center components by eliminating network traffic for existing local components.
* Allows each user to have only the content they use in their Desktop Content Center folder.

Disadvantages:

* Consumes considerable disk space on the client
* Each client must instantiate each referenced component in their Desktop Content Center folder

Private content example:

![](../images/illustration-privatecontent.png)

* Client 1 creates an instance of a component from the Content Center database. The instanced part file is written to the Desktop Content Center folder located on the client computer.
* User checks in the instanced component as part of an assembly. The Content part is copied into the Vault file store.

Note: Keeping the part file in the local folder removes the delays, for this user, due to instancing the part file or copying it from the file store.

* When the other Clients insert the same component that Client 1 used. Since the part does not yet exist in their Desktop Content Center Folder, it will be instanced from the local database.
* During the scheduled replication at each Autodesk Vault Server the Content Center components are replicated to the local file store at each site.

## Shared Content Center

The Content Center files are installed on the Autodesk Data Management Server. For more information about Content Center files and installing them with Inventor, see [What is the Content Center](GUID-E425A189-3DDA-4F89-B2CD-B5236D414DAE.htm).

##### Connected Workgroups

# Connected Workgroups

Configure connected workgroups to improve the performance of Microsoft SQL for [remote sites](GUID-A4D1FDB5-5C6F-4EC3-A13B-1F710B90B31D.htm).

## Learn About Connected Workgroups

You must understand replication before you can understand how Connected Workgroups operate.

### Replication

Replication is the process of copying data from one server to another server. The servers are usually located in two different physical locations. This setup allows a Vault environment in two locations so that it is not necessary to download large CAD files across a Wide Area Network (wan) connection.

### Workgroups

A workgroup is a group of users that share data via a local network.

A connected workgroup is a workgroup that can share data with other workgroups, using Microsoft SQL Publisher/Subscriber technology to support multiple database servers. This technology allows the replication of the SQL database at multiple locations.

### Requirements

* For servers not in the same domain, add a local Windows account (not-a-domain-account) for each agent at the appropriate nodes (use the same name and password at each node). For example, AutodeskRep.
* A shared folder on the Publisher where replication snap shots are stored and shared to remote SQL servers.
* A Windows account on the Publisher that has Read/Write permissions to the snap shot share.
* A Windows account that has Read permissions to Publisher's snap shot share.
* Server participating in the replication environment must be able to resolve remote servers by NetBIOS name.

  Note: It is recommended to avoid using NETBIOS non-compliant computer names for Vault Servers. Refer to the following Microsoft article: [Naming conventions for computer accounts.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/identity/naming-conventions-for-computer-domain-site-ou)
* SQL and http ports need to be open in firewalls for communication between servers.
* SQL Server Replication must be enabled. If not, run the SQL installation package again to modify the installation on the SQL server and enable replication. (Feature Selection > Instance Features > Database Engine Services > SQL Server Replication.)

### Recommendations

* Servers are in the same domain or two-way trusted domains.
* Servers are assigned static IP address.
* Use 1 domain user account for replication and snap shot access.

### Opening ports in Windows Firewall

* The AutodeskVault instance of SQL uses a Dynamic port.

  Find the port being used by your servers

  1. Open the SQL Server Configuration Manager
  2. Expand the SQL Server Network Configuration
  3. Select Protocols for AUTODESKVAULT
  4. In the right pane, double-click on TCP/IP
  5. Select the IP Address tab
  6. Scroll to the bottom of the list and find the port under the IP All section -> TCP Dynamic Ports
  7. Use this port number in the SQL AUTODESKVAULT line of the script below to open the dynamic port in the Windows firewall.

     Copy the following line into a batch file to open the necessary ports.

     @echo ========= SQL Server Ports ===================

     @echo Enabling SQLServer default instance port 1433

     netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="SQLServer" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=1433

     pause

     @echo Enabling Dedicated Admin Connection port 1434

     netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="SQL Admin Connection" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=1434

     pause

     @echo Enabling port for SQL Server Browser Service's 'Browse' Button

     netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="SQL Browser" dir=in action=allow protocol=UDP localport=1433

     pause

     @echo Enabling SQL Server Dynamic port

     netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="SQL AUTODESKVAULT" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=52404

     pause

     @echo ========= Misc Applications ==============

     @echo Enabling HTTP port 80

     netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="HTTP" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=80

     pause

```
Troubleshooting Tips

-    Use the SQL Management Studio to verify that you can connect to the remote SQL servers.
-    Use a web browser to verify you have port 80 open.
-    Use Windows Explorer and the replication user credentials to verify each server has access to the snap shot share.
```

## Connected Workgroups Overview

A connected workgroup is a configuration of file stores that have been replicated from one site to another and that are managed by the Microsoft SQL database. The following illustration shows a typical workgroup configuration. All sites in a single workgroup share the same Microsoft SQL server.

![](../images/illustration-multi-site-terminology.png)

To allow sites to have their own database server to increase SQL performance, Vault uses connected workgroups. The following illustration shows a workgroup with two different sites connected to a second workgroup with a single site.

![](../images/illustration-connected-workgroups-term.png)

## Create Connected Workgroups

The installation of a Connected Workgroup environment requires each component to be installed and configured in the correct order, as follows.

### Configure the Publisher

1. Install MS SQL on the computer where all the information is to be replicated from. This computer is known as the Publisher.

   * Make sure you enable replication during installation. See [Install SQL Server](sql-administration-tasks-for.html#install-sql-2019-server).
   * Make sure you set up one or more shared network folders. See [Use a Remote Database](decide-on-a-local-or-remote-sql.html#use-a-remote-database).
   * Autodesk recommends that you set up a "replication user" on the domain and make note of these credentials for the following steps. See [SQL Administration for Vault](GUID-6E35739D-CBCC-4211-9051-E451EBE3360C.htm).
2. After SQL is installed, log into the SQL AutodeskVault Instance through the SQL Server Management Studio. Right click the top level server name and select properties. Under the Connections tab, make sure that the option nocount is not selected.
3. Install Vault server on the Publisher.
4. After the Vault server is installed, start the Vault server console.
5. In the Vault server console, right-click Workgroups and select Enable Workgroup Replication.

   ![](../images/adms-enable-workgroup-replic.png)
6. Fill in the UNC path for the shared folder. For example: \\server\share\.

   ![](../images/adms-enable-workgroup-replic-dialog.png)
7. Enter the User ID, which is the user account configured for replication, and with full access to the shared folder, and click OK.
8. On the subscriber computer (the-target-for-replicated-data), install the same version of SQL that you just installed on the publisher.

   Note: Install this with a preconfigured instance named AutodeskVault and the same password as the publisher.
9. On the publisher, right-click Workgroups again in the Vault server console and select Add Workgroup.

   ![](../images/adms-add-workgroup.png)
10. Enter the appropriate information for the remote workgroup.

    If you created a replication user account, use those credentials under Remote Replication Credentials.

    ![](../images/enable-wg-rep.png)

A background process configures the remote SQL server as a subscriber, and starts to replicate the KVM database from the publisher. Once the secondary server has completed its configuration, it is added to the Workgroups tree in the console.

Note: Once you have done this, you can install the Vault server console on the subscriber and enable vault replication.

### Configure Firewalls

Before adding a workgroup be sure that the SQL server can communicate with the Vault server through the firewall. This can be done by allowing an exception for the SQL executables sqlbrowser.exe and sqlserver.exe.

### Enable Vault Replication

Once you have configured the publisher, you can install the Vault server console on the subscriber and enable Vault replication.

Note: For subscribing locations with slower network connections it is better to configure the server at the same location as the publisher and ship the server. If shipping a subscribing server to a different location, do not disconnect it from the network for more than 14 days to allow a successful replication once reconnected to the network.

1. Install Autodesk Data Management Server on the subscriber and have it point to the subscriber SQL Server that is also installed there.
2. On the publisher in the ADMS Console, right-click Workgroups and select Manage Replication.

   ![](../images/adms-enable-replication.png)
3. Select the Vault that you want to replicate.

   ![](../images/adms-enable-replication-select-vault.png)
4. Move the workgroups you want to replicate into the Replicated column using the >> button.

   ![](../images/enable-vault-rep.png)
5. On the subscriber, open the ADMS Console and expand the Vaults node.
6. Right-click the appropriate Vault and select Vault Enabled to enable the vault.

   ![](../images/adms-enable-replication-enable-vault1.png)
7. Select the appropriate file store location when prompted.

Vault opens information dialog boxes that describe the vault synchronization frequency and tell you that the vault has been enabled.

### Test Replication

1. Add a file to the publisher workgroup
2. Check the file out, modify it, and check it back in.
3. Move to a subscriber workgroup.
4. Repeat the same steps you did on the Publisher.

### Vault Client Installation from Autodesk Account

# Vault Client Installation from Autodesk Account

After you have installed the Vault Server, you can install the Vault client on any client machine. In addition, you can create a Custom Vault Deployment, and select language and a specific version of vault client installation.

## What is the Autodesk Vault Client?

A Vault client is any stand-alone application or integrated add-in that connects to the vault server to access files and perform vault operations.

The Vault clients work with the [Vault Server](GUID-ECD4A36F-582C-4413-A990-2989787FB6DD.htm), sometimes referred to as the Autodesk Data Management Server. The Vault Server must be installed and configured before the clients can access the server.

Note: Vault clients that integrate with an Autodesk design application require a licensed installation of the corresponding Autodesk application. Refer to the hardware and software requirements for each product.

## Vault Add-Ins for Supported CAD Applications

All the Vault CAD add-ins are installed together with Vault Client. CAD products installed after the Vault client is installed will automatically have the Vault add-in available.

## Before Installing

* Close all Autodesk and Microsoft applications before installation.
* Disable any virus scanning software before installing.
* Make sure that the Vault Client release that you are installing matches the release year of the Autodesk Data Management Server that you installed. For example, if you are upgrading to Autodesk Vault 2025, both server and client components must be upgraded to the same release year. [Refer to Upgrading Vault](GUID-F7C93287-98E9-4950-93A0-E7A3BC96181E.htm) for more information.

## Installation of Inventor Content Center

Before you install, determine whether Desktop Content or Autodesk Vault server best suits your needs.

Install Desktop Content (content-center-libraries-for-a-single-computer)

* Installs with Autodesk Inventor from the Autodesk Inventor media.
* Requires no additional software.
* A complete solution designed for stand-alone users who do not work in a shared environment.
* Installs Content Center libraries directly on your local computer.

Install missing Content Center libraries

If you forgot to install DIN libraries during your original configuration:

* Directly from your installation media, copy the relevant IDZ file to the Content Center library location on your PC. The IDZ file is an archived (zipped) IDCL file.

## Autodesk Vault server (content-center-libraries-for-a-shared-network-environment)

* Can be downloaded from [Autodesk Account Management Portal](https://manage.autodesk.com/products/vltm).
* Designed for users who run Autodesk Inventor on their local computers and work in a shared environment.
* Minimizes space requirements on the local computer.
* Provides the means to manage user accounts.

Note: You can use desktop content libraries from a network share. However, you cannot install desktop content to a network share from the install media. To achieve this network configuration, first install the Desktop content locally and then copy the content to a shared network location. In Application Options, Content Center tab Access Options, change the location of the libraries to the location that you copied the library files (.idcl) to.

Important: This type of shared environment does not provide the security control that is available from managing the libraries on the Vault server.

Note: You can use up to two previous versions of Inventor Content Center libraries with the current version of Vault after they have been migrated. For more details, see the [Migrate a Database](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?p=VAULT&l=ENU&accessmode=live&v=2026&guid=GUID-7C6C668C-4AC1-4199-BE04-268E5F80B949).

### Upgrade Autodesk Vault

# Upgrade Autodesk Vault

The Vault Upgrade Guide is a comprehensive look at upgrading your Vault environment to a new release year or edition of Autodesk Vault. Details are provided for releases from 2009 to the current Autodesk Vault release.

## What Is an Upgrade?

An upgrade means moving Vault data to a newer release (e.g.,-from-vault-2019-to-vault-2025).

## What Does Upgrading Entail?

The upgrade process for an Autodesk Vault environment is composed of five stages: validate backup, upgrade SQL, upgrade Vault server, upgrade clients, and create backup. The number of steps within each stage varies depending on the existing Vault implementation.

## Who Can Perform an Upgrade?

The instructions in the attached document assume that the administrator performing the upgrade is familiar with common server administration tasks. At a minimum, the administrator should be familiar with installing and uninstalling software on Microsoft Windows™.

## Where Can I Find Upgrade Assistance?

If there are concerns or additional complexities in the Autodesk Vault environment, the best practice is to involve your Value Added Reseller or Autodesk Consulting. This is especially important when using clustered SQL or business line integrations with Vault.

## What if I Have Questions about Upgrading SQL Express or SQL Standard?

Refer to the steps in [this section](GUID-F448B6E0-DEE2-409A-8C56-B09A3DC730E8.htm) for more information about upgrading SQL. For additional details about Microsoft SQL, see the Microsoft SQL help.

#### Introduction to Upgrading Vault

# Introduction to Upgrading Vault

This upgrade process applies to all Autodesk Vault product editions. Details are provided for releases 2009 and higher, however the general process can be applied to all releases.

![](../images/flow-vaultupgradeprocess.png)

An upgrade may mean a newer release, a higher product edition, or both. When upgrading, upgrade to the highest release first and then upgrade the product edition.

For example, if moving from Vault Workgroup 2021 to Vault Professional 2023, first upgrade the release to Vault Workgroup 2023 and then upgrade the edition to Vault Professional 2023.

The migration process for an Autodesk Vault environment is composed of five stages: validate backup, upgrade SQL, upgrade Vault server, upgrade clients, and create backup. The number of steps within each stage varies depending on the existing Vault implementation.

The instructions in this document assume that you are familiar with common server administration tasks. At a minimum, you should be familiar with installing and uninstalling software on Microsoft Windows™.

##### Phase 1–Validate Backup and Test Migration

# Phase 1–Validate Backup and Test Migration

Autodesk recommends that every Vault upgrade start with a validated backup.

![](../images/flow-autodeskvaultupgrade-phase1.png)

The following procedure for testing the upgrade is the preferred method for validating a backup.

![](../images/flow-phase1process.png)

## Test Environment

The best practice is to perform a test upgrade of the Vault server on a machine that is similar to the production server. A test upgrade provides confidence that the backup is valid and identifies potential pitfalls with no impact on the production environment. Following is an overview of test environment benefits.

| Test Machine Settings | Benefits |
| --- | --- |
| Similar CPU, memory, disk space | Provides an estimate of how long the migration can take. Gives insight into migration settings, such as time-out values to be changed. Exposes other configuration settings that may require changes. |
| Database | Test machines that need access to a vault that is 2 GB or more also need a similar version of full MicrosoftTM SQL server installed. |
| Other applications that are installed on the production server | Test for compatibility with various proxy clients, firewalls, anti-virus programs, etc. |
| Operating System, Service Packs, firewalls, etc. | Compatibility testing. |
| Microsoft® Windows® Administration settings | Check for compatibility with Windows Domain policies, login scripts, permissions, and other settings. |

If a test environment similar to production is not attainable, a low cost alternative is virtual machines like VMWare or Virtual PC from Microsoft. Virtual machines lack many of the benefits outlined above but are far better than not performing a backup and migration validation.

## Restore Backup

Use the Vault server application to restore the production backup in the test environment.

Migration Timeout

If the migration stops because of a timeout error, the following steps will help resolve the issue. In the ADMS Console look in the Console log for today’s date and search for ‘timeout’. If a timeout error is found, perform the following steps.

Look in the ADMS log file to determine if the cause is a timeout:

*C:\ProgramData\Autodesk\VaultServer\Filestore\ADMSConsoleLog-YYYYMMDD.txt*

Search the log file from the bottom up for ‘timeout.’ If a timeout error is found with a time stamp matching the time of the stopped migration, perform the following steps:

1. On the Vault server, open Windows Explorer and navigate to C:\Program Files\Autodesk\ADMS Product 20\_\_\Server\Web\Services.
2. Create a backup copy of the Web.config file.
3. Open the Web.config file with Notepad and look for the following line:

   Note: The values may be different from those shown.
4. Double the existing values for defaultcommand and longcommand.

   Note: If the defaultCommand value is set higher than 1000, increase the executionTimeout value to an equal or higher value. This is found on the following line: .
5. Save the Web.config file.
6. Open the ADMS console.
7. Perform one of the following sets of tasks:

   * If a yellow bang symbol appears next to a Vault, right click the vault and select migrate.
   * If no yellow symbol appears, close ADMS console and perform a build-to-build migration with the following steps:

     1. Open a command prompt and navigate to the installed location of Connectivity.ADMSConsole.exe.
     2. Run ADMS b2bmigrate operation in command line mode:

        Example: Connectivity.ADMSConsole.Exe -Ob2bmigrate -VUadministrator -VPadmin\_password -DBUsql\_user -DBPsql\_password Replace admin\_password with the appropriate administrator password for the -VP switch.

        The last two command line parameters, –DBU and –DBP, are required only if the sa password is not the default password.

## Validate Restored Data

Verify the filestore and databases are complete and that the restored environment is operational. Use a client to verify the content and the Vault server application to verify the configuration.

## Migration Test

Apply the processes detailed in this paper to the test environment. Using the test environment provides a safe option to experience the migration process and discover unexpected hurdles. Although this process takes time it can, in the long run, save time and stress by avoiding impact to the production environment.

##### Phase 2–Upgrade SQL

# Phase 2–Upgrade SQL

After you have validated your backup, upgrade your SQL to prepare for the Vault Server and Vault client upgrades.

![](../images/flow-autodeskvaultupgrade-phase2.png)

The stage Validate backup should be completed prior to starting Upgrade SQL.

## SQL Releases

The following chart summarizes the compatible releases of Vault and SQL with green dots. The yellow dots are the recommended upgrade path. Refer to the Vault System Requirements for your Vault release to ensure compatibility between Vault and SQL product editions.

![](../images/chart-sqlupgrade-vaultrelease-2026.png)

If a SQL upgrade is necessary, refer to the topic specific to your environment for a summary of the most common scenarios. Complete SQL documentation is available from Microsoft.

Important: Prior to upgrading SQL, review the next section in this document: [Upgrade Vault Server](GUID-E1B454DA-7967-48B7-BFDB-AE2A028E31B9.htm).

###### Upgrading Vault Server to Full SQL Server

# Upgrading Vault Server to Full SQL Server

When upgrading to the full version of Microsoft SQL Server, you must have permissions for the server and client systems, as well as to allow periodic system restarts. You should perform the upgrade in a test environment prior to performing the upgrade on the production environment. The client side systems are needed to verify that the upgrade has been performed successfully.

The server upgrade can be performed at any time after Autodesk Vault Server has been installed. The server may need to be rebooted one or two times during the upgrade process.

During the upgrade, the SQL server instance and the Autodesk Vault Server Services are shut down. Anyone logged into the vault at the time is automatically disconnected. Make sure all users are logged out of the Autodesk Vault Server. The upgrade will not affect the state of checked out files, nor will it modify the database structure, state of the files, or parent child relationships.

Before upgrading the SQL server, perform a backup from the Autodesk Vault Server Console application. For more information on backing up data, see the Autodesk Vault Server console Help.

###### Upgrade MS SQL Server and MS SQL Express

# Upgrade MS SQL Server and MS SQL Express

Upgrade MS SQL server to a newer version, or MS SQL Express to MS SQL Server.

## Upgrade versions of MS SQL Server

You can upgrade your version of MS SQL server to the more recent version of your preference; for example from 2008 to 2014, or 2012 to 2016, and so on.

1. From [http://www.microsoft.com](http://www.microsoft.com/), download the version of SQL Express you want to upgrade to.
2. Select Installation and begin the Upgrade from SQL Server 20XX.
3. Continue through the pre-installation process. Pre-request files and services are updated. Setup Support Rules are processed.
4. On the Select Instance screen, select the Autodesk Vault instance to upgrade and confirm instance settings. Click Next.
5. Accept the default features on the Select Features screen by clicking Next.
6. On the Instance Configuration screen, click Next.
7. On the Ready to Upgrade screen, click Upgrade. Setup will complete and upgrade the AutodeskVault SQL instance to the version you downloaded.

## Upgrade Microsoft SQL Express to Microsoft SQL Standard or Higher

Upgrade a SQL Express installation to a full version of SQL using a media which does not include a service pack, or higher, using one of the following methods.

Note: A server console backup is recommended before performing either of these methods

Method One

1. Run the full version of SQL setup application.
2. Select Maintenance > Edition Upgrade.
3. Select the AutodeskVault instance and start the upgrade.
4. After the upgrade is complete, apply the latest SQL service pack since this upgrade actually does not have on and it is not transferred from SQL Express.

Method Two

1. Create a full backup of your vault using the server console. Note: In later steps, you delete all your vault databases. Validate that you can restore this backup on a test server before proceeding. Do not continue if your test restore fails. Correct any problems you have with the backup before continuing these steps.
2. After the test restore is successful, open the ADMS Console and delete all vaults and libraries listed. Then select Detach Master Vault from the Tools menu.
3. Make sure that all users are logged out of the vault.
4. Completely uninstall SQL Express, including the following applications in this order:

   * Microsoft SQL Server 2XXX Note: If you have more than one instance of SQL Express installed, be sure to uninstall only the AutodeskVault instance. DO NOT uninstall any other part of SQL after this step is complete.
   * Microsoft SQL Server 20XX Browser
   * Microsoft SQL Server 20XX Native Client
   * Microsoft SQL Server 20XX Setup Support Files
   * Microsoft SQL Server VSS Writer
5. Delete the SQL Express folders from Program Files (including-data-files). If your Vault databases are located on a different drive, be sure to delete the files in this location as well.
6. Install the full version of SQL with an AUTODESKVAULT instance as in the "Pre-install Microsoft SQL Server" section.
7. Install the Microsoft SQL release for your Vault product.

   Note: Refer to the chart on [this page](GUID-F448B6E0-DEE2-409A-8C56-B09A3DC730E8.htm) or see your Vault System Requirements for which SQL release you should install.
8. Restore the backup that you created in step one using ADMS Console.

##### Phase 3–Upgrade the Vault Server

# Phase 3–Upgrade the Vault Server

After upgrading your SQL Server, you must upgrade your Vault Server. You can upgrade your Vault Server for Single Site or Multi-Site environments.

![](../images/flow-autodeskvaultupgrade-phase3.png)

The best practice is to complete the Validate Backup stage and review the stage for Upgrade SQL prior to starting Upgrade Vault Server.

Refer to the topic for your environment for more information.

## Single Site

Follow the instructions in this section for upgrading a Vault Server for a single site.

![](../images/process-vaultupgrade-singlesite.png)

### Upgrade One or Two Releases?

Upgrading one or two releases involves one installation of Vault server. Upgrading three or more releases requires intermediate installations of the Vault server.

For example, if upgrading from Vault Professional 2020 to Vault Professional 2025, use the ‘3 or More’ migration path.

### Verify SQL Version

Verify the existing version of SQL is compatible with the next Vault Release to be installed. If the existing SQL release requires an upgrade (see the [previous Help topic](Phase-2-Upgrade-SQL.htm)), upgrade the publisher SQL version first followed by all the subscribers, and then return to this section.

### Install Current Vault Server

Installing Vault server 2011 or a newer release supports automatic uninstall of Vault server 2010 or newer. Therefore, it is not necessary to uninstall Vault 2010 or a newer release.

During every installation of Vault server, enable the option to download and apply Service Packs.

At the end of the installation, you are prompted to start the Vault server application and migrate the Vaults. **Do not migrate the vaults at this time.**

### Apply Hot Fixes

All hotfixes created after the final Service Pack should be manually installed at each site. Installing the hot fixes ensures that the latest updates are applied for proper migration.

### Migrate Vaults

When Vault Server first launches, the administrator is prompted to migrate the vault and library databases. Users are not able to log into a vault until migration is complete. Do not migrate until all service packs and hot fixes have been applied.

If a service pack or hotfix is applied after migration, a build-to-build (b2b) migration is required. b2b migration is a command line option detailed in the section [Migration Timeout](Phase-1-Validate-Backup-and-Test.htm) and on the Autodesk Wiki.

## Upgrade Three or More Releases

Follow the instructions in this section if your Vault Server is three or more releases older than the release to which you are upgrading.

### Install Intermediate Releases

Each release of Autodesk Vault server supports migration from the previous two releases. When upgrading over three or more releases, it is necessary to migrate the SQL database through intermediate releases of Vault. This is done by installing every other release of the Vault server up to the final release.

For example: In order to migrate from 2021 to 2025, Vault 2023 must be installed as an intermediate step.

| Release | Supports Migration From | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2025 | 2024 | 2023 |
| 2024 | 2023 | 2022 |
| 2023 | 2022 | 2021 |
| 2022 | 2021 | 2020 |
| 2021 | 2020 | 2019 |
| 2020 | 2019 | 2018 |
| ... | ...-1 | ...-2 |

![](../images/flow-upgradevault-threeormorereleases.png)

### Verify SQL Version

Verify that the existing version of SQL is compatible with the next Vault release to be installed. If the existing SQL release requries an upgrade (see-the-preceding-chapter-in-this-paper-upgrade-sql) perform any necessary upgrades then return to this section.

### Apply Hot Fixes

All hotfixes created after the final Service Pack should be manually installed at each site. Installing the hotfixes ensures that the latest updates are applied for proper migration.

### Migrate Vaults and Libraries

Do not migrate the vaults until all service packs and hot fixes have been applied. When ready, start the Vault server application. The administrator is prompted to migrate the vault and library databases. Accept the offer and migrate all vaults.

The vaults must be migrated to the installed release before the next release of Vault can be installed. If a service pack or hotfix is applied after migration, a build-to-build (b2b) migration is required. b2b migration is a command line option detailed in the Migrate Vault Data After Installing a Hot Fix or Update section of the Autodesk Vault Online Help.

### If Installed Vault Server is Still Three or More Releases Older than the Final Release

If the installed release is three or more releases older than the final release, repeat the steps in Upgrade Three or More Releases.

### Installed Vault Server is One or Two Releases Older than Final Release

If the installed release is one or two releases older than the final release, then no more intermediate releases are required. Go to the steps in Single Site.

## Multiple Sites

Autodesk Vault supports two styles of replicating data across multiple sites. First is a workgroup where there are multiple installations of the Vault server connecting to and sharing one SQL server. The second type is full replication where there are two or more replicated SQL servers. Further details are available on the Vault wiki.

### Upgrade Three or More Vault Releases with Multi-Site or Replication

The concept of an intermediate installation is introduced in the section.

Upgrade Three or More Releases under Single Site within this document. The purpose of the intermediate installation is to ensure proper migration of the SQL database (this migration applies to the database not the content). In a multi-site or replication environment, the first server upgraded migrates the SQL database. Therefore installation of intermediate Vault releases is only required for the first server upgraded. After the first site is migrated to the final release, all of the other sites can install the final release and skip intermediate releases of Vault server.

![](../images/flow-upgrade-multiplesites.png)

#### Upgrade Workgroup

In a workgroup any of the Vault servers may be the first to upgrade. The selected site will also migrate the SQL database. All other sites will be unable to access the SQL server until they are brought up to the same product, release, and service pack.

Best practice is to start with the site that has the fastest connection to the SQL server. When ready to perform the upgrade, follow the steps outlined in the section Single Site. Upgrade the selected server to the final release and service pack before moving onto other sites.

When the first site update is complete, install Vault server at the remaining sites. If upgrading from Vault server 2009 or older, uninstall the Vault server at all other sites. Then install the final release and service pack, skipping intermediate releases. The intermediate server releases are not required at the other workgroup sites.

#### Upgrade Connected Workgroups

Migration of a fully replicated environment must start with the Publisher workgroup. All subscriber workgroups must be online and available during migration of the publisher. As long as one Vault server and the SQL server are available from a workgroup, that workgroup is considered available. If a subscriber workgroup is offline and cannot be made available, postpone the migration.

Validate the replication status of all workgroups and databases prior to migration. If replication issues exist, they must be resolved before proceeding. Details about replication status are available on the Vault wiki under Administrator’s Tasks/Manage Replication.

Migrate one site from the publisher workgroup following the steps in the section Single Site. Installing the Vault server automatically migrates the SQL database. The SQL database migration is automatically replicated to all subscriber databases. After installation of the Vault server at the first site is complete, install the final Vault release, service packs, and hot fixes at all other sites across all workgroups.

If intermediate server releases are required they are only necessary on the first server. All other Vault servers in all workgroups should install the final Vault server release, service packs, and hot fixes, skipping intermediate releases.

##### Phase 4–Upgrade Vault Clients

# Phase 4–Upgrade Vault Clients

After you upgrade the Vault Server, you should upgrade your Vault Clients.

![](../images/flow-autodeskvaultupgrade-phase4.png)

**Vault and Forward Compatibility**

The Vault ADMS server supports the two previous client releases. This provides Enterprise and SMB operators who need to stagger the client and server side roll out the flexibility to do so.

## Upgrade Vault Clients

The Autodesk Vault clients are available with the product installation media as well as on the Autodesk Vault media.

The Autodesk Vault add-in for Microsoft® Office is shipped with your software. It can be used with one or more of the following Microsoft products when installed and registered on your machine.

* Word® 2016
* Excel® 2016
* PowerPoint® 2016

To install the Autodesk Vault clients, you must have either Microsoft Windows administrator or power user privileges.

Install the Clients for an Autodesk Design Application

Insert the installation media for the Autodesk design application and follow the instructions for the installation wizard.

Install the Clients for a non-Autodesk Design Application

Insert the installation media for the application and follow the instructions to install the software.

Install clients from the Autodesk Vault Media

1. Insert the Autodesk Vault media.
2. Double-click setup.exe.
3. Follow the instructions in the installation wizard.

Add-in Integration

If a design application is on the computer before the clients are installed, the corresponding add-in clients automatically integrate with the design applications. However, if an application is installed after the Vault client, action is required. Go to the Control Panel and modify the Vault client installation to add the missing add-in.

##### Phase 5–Create Backup

# Phase 5–Create Backup

The best practice is to create a backup of the vault as soon as the upgrade is complete.

![](../images/flow-autodeskvaultupgrade-phase5.png)

Perform a validation of the backup using the process described in the first stage of this document.

**Parent page:** [Introduction to Upgrading Vault](GUID-77487172-0582-4912-83B1-2E4847716AE0.htm)


#### Upgrade a Vault File Server to a Connected Workgroup Subscriber

# Upgrade a Vault File Server to a Connected Workgroup Subscriber

Upgrade a Vault Site Server that is currently a member of an established Workgroup to a Connected Workgroup Subscriber.

## Example Scenario

This pictures shows one Workgroup for simplification purposes. However it could be possible to already have multiple Workgroups configured.

![](../images/illustration-upgradevault-connectedworkgroup-world.png)

Current State: Workgroup A consists of a Publisher and two sites.

![](../images/illustration-upgrade-connectedworkgroupa.png)

End State: Two Workgroups, Workgroup A is the Publisher, workgroup-b is a Subscriber

![](../images/illustration-upgrade-connectedworkgroupbanda.png)

## Upgrade a Vault File Server to a Connected Workgroup Subscriber

Follow these instructions to make one of your Vault Server sites a connected workgroup subscriber to a Vault Site/Publisher.

1. On the site that is to be upgraded to be an SQL Subscriber, copy or backup the file store.
2. On a different site in Workgroup A, delete the file store in the ADMS Console.
3. On the site being upgraded, install SQL Server.

   Note: SQL can be installed on the same machine as Vault File Server or on a separate machine.
4. On the Publisher, add a Workgroup pointing to the newly installed SQL Server (workgroup-b).
5. After Replication has completed, Install the Vault Server application and connect it to the Subscriber SQL Server.
6. Start the ADMS Console on the SQL Subscriber.
7. Enable the Vault that is to be replicated and connect it to the existing File Store from step 1.

### Orphaned LP existence for Vault

# Orphaned LP existence for Vault

When you uninstall an Autodesk Vault Beta release, the language pack may not fully be removed from your system. This prevents any future successful installations of Autodesk Vault.

To resolve the problem:

1. Uninstall the orphaned language packs using Windows Control Panel.
2. Reinstall Vault.
3. If you are prompted to remove language packs but there are no language pack entries in the Control Panel, open a CMD window and uninstall any remaining language pack using the command line:

   Identify the corresponding 3-digit language product code for the orphaned language pack from the below product code table.

   | *Language* |  |

### Uninstall Autodesk Vault

# Uninstall Autodesk Vault

There are two stages to uninstalling Autodesk Vault. You must first uninstall the product using the Control Panel and then remove the Autodesk Vault Server. Follow the steps in this section to uninstall Autodesk Vault and remove all components for the Autodesk Data Management Server.

How you uninstall Autodesk software varies according to the operating system you use and the software you want to remove. See [Remove Autodesk software](https://www.autodesk.com/support/download-install/individuals/manage/remove-autodesk-software) for detailed information.

## Uninstall Autodesk Vault Using the Control Panel

Note: Uninstalling any application or application component may cause other applications not to work properly.

1. Open the Microsoft Windows Control Panel. Select Programs And Features to see a list of installed software.
2. Select the Autodesk application to uninstall.
3. Click Uninstall.
4. In the Autodesk Maintenance Wizard, click Uninstall.
5. Follow the instructions in the wizard to proceed with uninstalling the selected product.

## Remove the Vault Server

Important: When you remove the Autodesk Vault Server, you are required to uninstall the SQL server and remove the AUTODESKVAULT instance. Uninstalling the SQL server and removing the AUTODESKVAULT instance prevents any previously-used data from being automatically migrated. As a result, user-created Content Center libraries will not be available in the new Autodesk Data Management Server (adms) installation unless you attach them or import them manually.

Removing the Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL$AUTODESKVAULT" folder deletes all vault data and Content Center libraries from the default install location. If you need to access these libraries at a later date, be sure to make a back-up prior to removing this folder.

### Remove all components of the Autodesk Data Management Server

Important: These steps permanently remove all vault and Content Center library data. Do not proceed with these steps unless your vault and library data have been backed up. Perform these steps only if you intend to completely remove all of the Autodesk Data Management Server components and associated data.

Remove Microsoft SQL Express Adv 20xx.

1. From the Microsoft Windows Add or Remove Software dialog, select Microsoft SQL Express Adv 20xx, depending on your SQL installation.
2. Click Remove.
3. In the Microsoft SQL Server Uninstall dialog box, select the Remove SQL Server Instance Components check box and then select AUTODESKVAULT: Database Engine.
4. Click Next.
5. Microsoft SQL Server sequentially numbers instance folders. Once the instance has been removed using the Control Panel, locate and remove the folder MSSQL.n where n represents the number assigned to the AUTODESKVAULT instance folder. For more information on removing this folder, see the Microsoft SQL Server help. By default, this is installed at C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL.1.

Note: Removing SQL Server AUTODESKVAULT Database Engine prevents any previously-used data from migrating automatically. Therefore, user Content Center libraries are not available in the new adms installation unless you attach them or import them manually.

Removing the C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL.n folder deletes all vault data and Content Center libraries from the default install location. If you need to access these libraries at a later date, make a back-up prior to removing this folder.

Customize the Vault through the API.

If you know how to program, there are a large amount of customization possibilities though the Vault Application Programming Interfaces (apis). Common customizations include utilities, automations, integrations with other systems, commands and data views.

## Overview of using the API to customize the Autodesk Vault

There are three apis for Vault:

* **Web Service API** Allows communication with the Autodesk Data Management Server (adms). Use this API any time you want to get or set server data.
* **Vault Client API** Allows customization of the Vault client. Use this API to add custom commands and tabs to the UI.
* **Job Processor API** Allows customization of the Job Processor client. Use this API to add handlers for custom job types in the job service queue.

The Web Service API is available in all version of Vault. However, the Vault Client and Job Processor apis are only available for Vault Workgroup and Vault Professional.

## Vault Developer Framework (vdf)

The vdf is a high-level framework on top of the existing API that provides:

* Reusable business logic for common vault algorithms
* Reusable GUI controls for common workflows
* Extensible components that can be configured to match host requirements

Learn more about the vdf feature set [here](vdf-Feature-Set.htm).

## Vault sdk

Programmers interested in creating their own Vault programs can use the Vault Software Development Kit (sdk). It gets automatically installed with the Vault server. You can find it in the "sdk" folder under your "adms" install location.

The sdk contains useful tools, such as documentation on all classes and functions, sample applications, knowledge base articles, utilities, error code descriptions, and changes from previous releases. It has everything you need to get started writing your own Vault programs.

A language pack is available for the Vault sdk. Refer to Doug Redmond's blog, [It's All Just Ones and Zeroes](http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2013/07/vault-2014-api-language-pack.html), for more information on downloading and using the language pack.

## Visual Basic

You can write iLogic rules using only Autodesk Inventor parameter assignment statements, predefined iLogic functions, and simple VB.NET code. However, you are not limited to these techniques. You can use more advanced features of VB.NET in a rule. Visual Basic can be used to create external DLL files that can be called from rules (you-can-also-call-dll-files-written-in-c#-or-c++).

## Vault Customization Blog

[It's All Just Ones and Zeros](https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/) is an Autodesk blog devoted specifically to Vault customization and programming. It contains in-depth articles on API concepts, programming tips and tricks and announcements. Best of all it contains a large library of sample applications, with source code included

## Autodesk Developer Network

The [Autodesk Developer Network](http://www.autodesk.com/joinadn) (ADN) fully supports the Vault apis. They have knowledge base articles, additional sample code, product downloads and they can generate developer licenses for Vault Workgroup and Professional. If you get stuck on something, you can ask questions through their Dev Help Online page.

### VDF Feature Set

# VDF Feature Set

The VDF feature set consists of individual controls and workflows that are necessary for building a consistent, powerful, integrated Autodesk Vault experience within your application.

The most common workflows are available in pre-packaged units such as Log In and Browse the Vault. Some controls are available as stand alone components for when you need to create a more custom experience but retain the look/feel and functionality of the key pieces. Over time, the VDF feature set will continue to grow, offering more advanced workflows.

## GUI Features

Several controls are available for customizing the user-interface.

#### Log in

# Log in

The VDF provides mechanisms for logging into a vault. A login can be performed with or without a GUI.

![](../images/dialog-vdf-login.png)

## Login GUI Features

The Login GUI provides various features for logging in to a vault.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| *Auto Login* | |
|  | The GUI can be enabled to allow automatic login. The next time the application runs, it remembers the user's credentials and logs in on the user's behalf. |
| *Persistence* | |
|  | The GUI remembers the user name, server, and vault used for the last login. The GUI also keeps a history of the last several servers and vaults that were used. |
| *Customized Anonymous Login* | |
|  | The labels of the Anonymous login can be configured to display the brand for the host application. For example, the text can be changed to "Content Center Login." |
| *Vault Browsing* | |
|  | The login dialog allows the user to select from a list of vaults available on a particular server. |

## General Login Features

The following features are available with or without the login GUI.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| *Multiple Types of Logins* | |
|  | * Standard. A Vault connection using a user name and password. * Windows Authentication * Anonymous * Read-Only * Server-Only. A connection where a user logs into a server, but not a specific vault. |
| *Connection Caching* | |
|  | If two logins occur with the same credentials, the connection object is shared. |
| *Asynchronous Execution* | |
|  | All login activity occurs asynchronously. If the user types an incorrect server, instead of waiting 30 seconds for a timeout, the user can click cancel immediately and type in new credentials. |
| *Progress* | |
|  | Specify a progress callback to get a report on the progress of the login operation. |
| *Errors Detected* | |
|  | The following errors are detected by the login business logic:   * Invalid User Name * Invalid Vault Name * Invalid Server Name * Invalid Credentials (user-name-and-password-pair-do-not-match) * Server does not exist or cannot be reached * Vault does not exist on the server * Client is not compatible with the server version * Client is not compatible with the server products |

#### Select Entity from Vault

# Select Entity from Vault

Select Entity from Vault is a GUI workflow that allows the user to navigate the vault and select an entity for an event.

The event can be to Open, Save, or any other event workflow. The labels and buttons in the GUI can be customized to support the workflow.

![](../images/dialog-vdf-selectentityfromvault.png)

The Select Entity from Vault dialog can be used to select files, folders, items, or any other vault entity.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| *Look in Customization* | |
|  | The top level entities in the Look In combobox can be configured. These entities are always visible and they can be expanded to show children as the user drills down the hierarchy. |
| *Persistence* | |
|  | The dialog remembers its settings (column-configuration,-view-type,-and-other-options). The caller can configure how the options are saved. For example, an Open and a Save workflow can share the same dialog settings, or each workflow can have its own settings. |
| *Select Revision* | |
|  | The revision control allows the user to select a particular file revision for the Select Entity from Vault event. This feature can be disabled. When disabled, the combobox and its label are removed from the dialog. |
| *Released Biased* | |
|  | The released biased option is a toggle button that can be included on the dialog to indicate whether released data should take priority over non-released data when an entity in the vault is selected. For example, if there are two revisions of a file in the vault, and one of them is in a released state, the selection automatically defaults to the released revision.  The Release Biased toggle button can be configured to default to released or non-released. |
| *Multi-select* | |
|  | The dialog can support the selection of multiple entities or just a single entity. |
| *Configurable Text* | |
|  | The following elements can have their text replaced by user-specified values:   * *Dialog Caption* For example, in the dialog image, the Dialog Caption is configured as "Open from Vault." * *Selection Label* For example, in the dialog image, the Selection Label is configured as "File name." * *Initial Selection* The initial value of the text box next to the Selection Label. * *Selection Filter Label* For example, in the dialog image, the Selection Filter Label is configured as "Files of Type." * *Action Button Text* For example, in the dialog image, the Action Button text is configured as "Open." |
| *Configurable Text* | |
|  | The filters (e.g., Files of Type in the dialog image) can be configured. Filters based on file type, regular expression, or any other custom algorithm can be added to the combobox. |
| *Action Button Options* | |
|  | The action button text can be customized (e.g., Open, Save, etc.). Additionally, the action button can be granted options which display as a drop-down menu. For example, the Open button could have a drop-down menu with choices that include Open (Check Out), Open (Check Out All), and Open (Read Only). |
| *Target Entity* | |
|  | Configure the entity type on which the select entity action takes place. For example, if the dialog is configured to act only on files, then if an item is selected the action button (in this case, Open), would be disabled. |
| *Initial Vault Location* | |
|  | Configure the default vault location that displays when the dialog is activated. If the default location is not specified, the dialog displays the files located at $/. |
| *Entities to Hide* | |
|  | Configure the dialog so that only certain entities are shown when the user navigates the vault. For example, if the user is selecting an attachment for FOO.TXT, then it is reasonable to hide FOO.TXT from the selection list. |
| *Restrict Navigation* | |
|  | If restrict navigation is enabled, then the dialog displays only the contents of the Initial Vault location. The user cannot drill down into folders or other containers. |
| *Sidebar Control* | |
|  | An optional control can be included on the left edge of the dialog as a way for developers to add additional functionality to the dialog. A control may also be placed on the bottom left edge of the Open/Cancel/Help button area. |
| *Validate Extensibility* | |
|  | A custom handler can be supplied to validate the operation when the action button is clicked. The handler can display any prompts or errors as it sees fit, and it can decide whether or not the dialog box should close. |
| *Context Menus* | |
|  | The context menus that display when the user right-clicks on any of the files in the grid can be customized. |
| *View Switcher* | |
|  | The display can change between a details view, list view, small icon view, or large icon view. The icon views support zooming in and out of thumbnails. |
| *Grid Configuration* | |
|  | The grid has all of the capabilities of the Vault Browser Control. |

**Parent page:** [VDF Feature Set](GUID-1E65A09E-D9DC-42A8-871B-568004C43A56.htm)


#### Vault Browser Control

# Vault Browser Control

The Vault Browser control is used for displaying detailed information about the entities stored within a vault. It supports all types of entities and all types of properties.

Multiple views are available within the grid including list view, icon view, and detail view. Object data is displayed in the grid using a spreadsheet-like layout of rows and columns. Each column in the grid represents a property in the vault. The grid can be customized by the end-user to show only the properties that are of interest.

![](../images/vdf-dialog-gridoverview.png)

## Available Views

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| *Detail Grid View* | |
|  |  |
| *List View* | |
|  |  |
| *Thumbnail View (medium-icon-view)* | |
|  |  |

## File Browsing Grid Control Features

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| *Column Customization and Persistence* | |
|  | Columns in the grid control can be dragged and dropped in any order. All available columns are visible in a column chooser dialog to be added to the grid. The control remembers the custom column configuration and restores it the next time that the control is loaded. |
| *Column Header Context Menu* | |
|  | The context menu for each column header provides a number of options for customizing the information presented in that column. |
| *Column Quick List* | |
|  | The column quick list provides easy access to often-used columns, so they can be shown or hidden in the grid. |
| *Custom Properties/Columns* | |
|  | New properties and their corresponding columns can be created programmatically and added to an instance of the browser control. They operate exactly like columns created by the framework itself, except the data and configuration is provided by you. In the following image, the checkbox column and the Local Path column are both custom properties. |
| *Custom Styling* | |
|  | The fonts, foreground, and background colors of entities in the detail grid view are fully customizable. This customization can either be done on a per-row basis, or on individual cells in a specific column. |
| *Custom Tooltips* | |
|  | The default tooltip behavior of the detail grid control can be overridden. A custom tooltip handler can be associated with a column across all browser controls, or can be associated with a specific vault browser control. |
| *Customizable Context Menus* | |
|  | The context menus created when right-clicking in the body of the control are completely customizable. The control provides a default set of entries based on where the user clicked. These items can be added, removed, or modified at will. The context menus for the column headers are not customizable at this time. |
| *Entity Filtering* | |
|  | Specific entities can be filtered out of the list of displayed entities. You provide your own function as the filter. Each entity is passed through the filter before it is displayed, giving you a chance to hide it. |
| *Find Panel* | |
|  | This panel can be activated from the column header context menu. When active it can be used to search the current list of entities. As you type, the list is filtered down to only entities matching the search text. |
| *Hot Cells* | |
|  | Columns in the grid can be customized to turn their cells into "hot cells." These cells can have a custom tooltip. A custom action can be performed when the user CTRL-clicks on the tooltip. As shown in the following image, files that are assigned to an item can use the hot cell mechanism to link to that item. |
| *Incremental Search* | |
|  | When focus is on the grid control it will search as you type, selecting and jumping to whichever item in the list matches the typed characters. |
| *Override Selection* | |
|  | When right-clicking outside the collection of currently selected entities, the grid control supports a temporary override selection in all of its available views. This selection lasts as long as the context menu is up and temporarily replaces the regular selection reported by the control. This can be programmatically enabled or disabled. |
| *Pluggable Navigation Models* | |
|  | The vault browser control supports plugging in different navigation models that conform to a specific interface. These models control how the grid responds to user input.  There are two pre-made models: a vault browsing model and a vault viewing model. The browsing models is designed for navigating through a vault and drilling down into containers such as folders and items. The viewing model is designed to view a collection of vault entities without any navigation. |
| *Single Select & Multi-select* | |
|  | The browser control supports selecting multiple entities at a time or a single entity at a time. You can programmatically switch between these two modes. |
| *Support for Custom Entities* | |
|  | The browser control has full support for custom entities. All of the features that operate on files and folders also work with custom entities. |

#### Download/Check out

# Download/Check out

Download and/or check out files is functionality that lets users obtain a copy of an entity in a vault. The copy can be downloaded to a local working folder, checked out of the vault but not downloaded, or both.

![](../images/dialog-vdf-getcheckout-collapsed.png)

This functionality is accessible in silent mode, with a light GUI, and with a fully configurable GUI.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| *Modes of Operation* | |
|  | There are three modes of operation: silent, light GUI, and Full GUI.   * *Silent* The business logic for download/check out happens with no GUI interaction. All progress, restrictions, and local file validations are handled through customizable call-backs. * *Light GUI* When a download starts, a progress dialog appears throughout the operation. Message boxes and restrictions dialogs might pop up to address problems as they occur. * *Full GUI* An interactive GUI appears that allows users to modify the options (gathering-options,-which-files-to-check-out,-comments,-download-location,-etc.). This GUI allows files to be viewed in a List View, Folder View, or Design View. All of the views support configurable columns which include support for thumbnails.  The Download/Check out dialog has a collapsed and expanded display.  **Collapsed**      **Expanded** |
| *Restrictions* | |
|  | The VDF detects if any of the following conditions exist prior to attempting the download.   * File is checked out to someone else. * File is checked out to the current user on a different machine. * File is checked out to the current user in a different directory. * File is locked and cannot be edited. * File is checked out to another user in the same shared directory.   If the condition does exist, there is a choice as to whether or not the operation should be canceled or continued by skipping files with the problem(s).    The logic that decides how to handle the problem is extensible, and a custom resolution engine can be supplied. |
| *Local Disk Synchronization* | |
|  | The VDF checks if the file on disk is out of sync with the version of the file in the vault. In this scenario, there is a choice as to whether the file should be overwritten or if the download should be skipped. The resolution logic is extensible and the default handling can be replaced with a custom solution.      The following scenarios are detected:   * If the file on disk is the same version and has the same checksum as the file being downloaded, the download is skipped. * If the file on disk is already checked out to the current user in the same location. * If the file on disk is newer than the file being downloaded. * If the vault file does not exist on the remote server that the user logged into and it needs to be replicated. |
| *Parallel Processing* | |
|  | The parallel processing feature allows for multiple files to be downloaded at the same time. |
| *Relationship Gathering* | |
|  | When downloading or checking out a file, you can specify whether any related files are also downloaded or checked out. The VDF supports relationships for including child relationships, parent relationships, or files brought in through links.   * Include Child Relationships        * Include Parent Relationships * Include Linked Entities |
| *Multiple Entity Download* | |
|  | The VDF not only supports file and folder downloads, it also supports entities such as items, change orders, or custom objects. The VDF interrogates these entities and selects the primary files associated with them for download. |
| *Progress Extensibility* | |
|  | The download/check out operations report progress via an interface. A custom progress provider can be supplied to redirect the progress to a console, log file, status bar, or other handler. |
| *Options* | |
|  | Additional entity options exist for configuration.   * The revision of the source file to download can be configured. * The release biased option can be configured. * The download location can be configured (i.e., working folders, no download, or custom location). * The check out command can be configured. |
| *File Resolution* | |
|  | When a file is downloaded, it can optionally detect if references in the file (i.e., an assembly with references to parts) are out of date. The VDF has the ability to fix out-of-date references automatically during the download.  This feature uses the pluggable Extension Handler system and works for any VDF client (including the add-ins) running on a machine that has the Extension Handlers installed. |

### Developing with the VDF

# Developing with the VDF

This section is intended to aid developers who are using the Vault SDK and wish to leverage the workflows and utilities provided by the VDF in their own applications.

Below is an overview of how the VDF is organized which will aid developers when searching through the SDK documentation (included-in-the-sdk-installer) for classes and methods.

## How the VDF is Organized

The VDF is a new part of the SDK and it isn't a flat collection of web service API methods like previous versions of the SDK, so it is worth understanding how the VDF is organized. Currently, the VDF consists of four DLLs with the prefix Autodesk.DataManagement.Client.Framework on their names and the namespaces defined within them. Here's the list:

* Autodesk.DataManagement.Client.Framework.dll
* Autodesk.DataManagement.Client.Framework.Forms.dll
* Autodesk.DataManagement.Client.Framework.Vault.dll
* Autodesk.DataManagement.Client.Framework.Vault.Forms.dll

As a shorthand, the Autodesk…Framework prefix is often replaced simply with the string "VDF." For example, the Autodesk.DataManagement.Client.Framework.Vault namespace would simply be referred to as VDF.Vault to save keystrokes. As you can might notice, there are some similarities between different pairs of the DLLs. Two of them contain "Vault" in their name, while a different two contain "Forms" in their name.

The DLLs (and-the-namespaces-they-contain) that have "Vault" in their name have components that are specific to working with Vault concepts such as Vault related currency and services for talking to a Vault server. The DLLs without "Vault" in their names have more general purpose utilities such as services for managing generic persisted preferences and components useful for displaying prompts to users. The "Forms" DLLs contain WinForms components and workflows that will often display GUI to users while the DLLs without "Forms" in their names don't contain any GUI components. Often times, there are two versions of the a given workflow provided by the VDF, a GUI version and a non-GUI version. GUI versions of a workflow will reside within a "Forms" namespace. Any client applications that don't require GUI don't need to deploy the VDF Forms DLLs.

Most of the functionality provided by the VDF is accessed via one of two entry points: static Library classes in each DLL or through services off the VDF Connection class. The static Library classes reside in the namespace matching the name of each DLL, i.e. the VDF.Vault.dll will have a VDF.Vault.Library class with static methods and services to be used by client applications. The Library classes mostly provide access to GUI workflows (if-within-a-"forms"-namespace) or workflows and services that don't require a VDF connection. The other entry point, a VDF Connection object (of the VDF.Vault.Currency.Connection.Connection class), requires the client application to connect to a Vault server to obtain a connection. The Connection object has several services that interact with a Vault server, such as the FileManager for downloading file or the WorkingFolder. For those familiar with the 2013 Vault SDK, it also provides access to a WebServiceManager if clients need to make any web service API calls directly.

#### Enable VDF Functionality

# Enable VDF Functionality

When using the VDF, there are some settings that you must provide to enable full functionality.

Although the VDF will still operate normally without these settings, features will be missing if you do not provide all settings.

What follows is a summary of which assemblies and services contain the settings you need to supply. These settings affect the VDF globally and are not for any specific workflow.

## Autodesk.DataManagement.Client.Framework.Forms.Library

ApplicationConfiguration Service: This service contains a number of configuration options that help integrate the VDF into your application.

* ApplicationIcon - This allows you to set the icon that is used by all the dialogs in the VDF. If this is not set, no icon will be displayed.
* MainFont - The VDF normally uses the system default font. If you provide a font here, that font will be used instead.
* CustomHelpProvider - To activate help in the VDF, you should provide an implementation of the ICustomHelpProvider interface here. Without this provider, help buttons will be hidden and help will not work in the VDF.

## Autodesk.DataManagement.Client.Framework.Vault.Library

LocalFileLocation Service: This service computes the paths where configuration files are stored by the VDF.

* VaultCommonPath - This property returns the location for Vault data that is shared between multiple applications that use the Vault SDK. For example, the VDF Login workflow stores the history of servers and vaults in this location.

ConectionManager Service: This service helps handle all connections to a vault server. It provides utilities for checking what products the server supports and what products your application requires.

* SetProductRequirements - This sets which Autodesk Vault products your application requires, such as Vault Workgroup or Vault Professional. For each product, you can set required, optional, or restricted. These requirements are checked when logging into a server. If they are not met, an error is shown and the login fails.

## Autodesk.DataManagement.Client.Framework.Vault.Forms.Library

SetCulture(system.globalization.cultureinfo-info): This will set the culture that this assembly and all its dependencies will use when returing resources. Threads are created using the culture of the operating system by default, so if your culture is different you must call this function to get properly translated resources. This method exists in all the static Library classes in the VDF if you are not using all 4 DLLs.

**app.config**

To reduce memory usage and improve performance for file transfers, the .NET app.config file for your application consuming the VDF needs to be modified. Find or create the  portion and add the following line:

```
<section name="microsoft.web.services3" type="Microsoft.Web.Services3.Configuration.WebServicesConfiguration, Microsoft.Web.Services3, Version=3.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35"/>
```

Then, add the following somewhere in the  section:

```
<microsoft.web.services3>
    <messaging>
      <maxMessageLength value="51200">
      </maxMessageLength>
      <mtom clientMode="On"/>
    </messaging>
    <security>
            <timeToleranceInSeconds value="86400"/>
    </security>
  </microsoft.web.services3>
```

#### Connecting to a Vault

# Connecting to a Vault

The VDF connection is one of the key access points to the services provided by the VDF.

A VDF connection is represented by an instance of the VDF.Vault.Currency.Connection.Connection class. In order to obtain a VDF Connection object, client applications will have to log in to a Vault server. The VDF provides a both GUI log-in and non-GUI programmatic log-in methods that return either a result object containing the newly created VDF connection or the connection object directly.

To perform a GUI log-in, client apps should call the VDF.Vault.Forms.Library.Login() method. This methods takes a VDF.Vault.Forms.Settings.LoginSettings object that allows clients to adjust the behavior of the VDF's log-in. The GUI log-in will display a dialog prompting users for log-in information, display log-in progress, and manage persistence of log-in data, etc. Examples of its use can be found in the sample applications packaged with the Vault SDK (for example, the VaultFileBrowser sample).

The non-GUI log-in allows client apps to provide the log-in credentials directly to the VDF without having to prompt for user input. The non-GUI log-in is done using the VDF.Vault.Library.ConnectionManager.Login() method. More information about both log-in methods and their settings/parameters can be found in the SDK documentation. Once you have a VDF connection, client applications can begin using it to interact with the Vault server via services such as the File Manager service or by providing the connection object to Library methods that require a connection.

## Moving from Vault 2013 SDK's WebServiceManager to the VDF's Connection

The VDF Connection class provides access to a WebServiceManager instance that shares the same Vault server connection, so any existing code written using the 2013 SDK's WebServiceManager should convert easily to using the VDF connection class. Simply replace references to a WebServiceManager instance with calls to the WebServiceManager property of an active VDF Connection instance. The only other changes client applications will need is how they obtain a connection. As mentioned in the section above, client applications will have to use one of the log-in methods to obtain a VDF Connection. For client applications that would prefer to have minimal change, the VDF's non-GUI log-in maps pretty close to the WebServiceManager's constructor, and so, client applications can simply swap out the creation of a WebServiceManager with a VDF log-in. For example, these two code snippets will result in essentially the same Vault connection:

Using web service manager (c#):

![](../images/screenshot-vdfconnect.png)

Using VDF log-in (c#):

![](../images/screenshot-vdfconnectwithcsharp.png)

The other thing client applications will need to adjust is how they sign-out/dispose of the Vault connection. While the WebServiceManager was an IDisposable, the VDF Connection is not and it is recommended to release the Vault connection by passing the VDF connection you wish to log out of to the ConnectionManager's Logout() method.

#### Downloading Files with the VDF

# Downloading Files with the VDF

One of the workflows provided by the VDF is downloading a file. When downloading a file from Vault, there are usually several other steps involved besides just pulling down the bits from the Vault server.

These include things like determining the working folder location for the file, displaying a progress dialog, repairing broken file reference due to moves or renames, etc. Even if client apps don't need any of this business logic, the VDF layer provides additional benefits such as performance improvements with parallel downloading of files and hiding the complexity of dealing with the Filestore service.

Like several of the areas of functionality provided by the VDF, there are both GUI and non-GUI versions of acquire files API methods. The non-GUI acquire file method is accessed off the FileManager service which lives off the VDF Connection class. This service provides a few different methods for working with Vault files. The specific method to use for downloading one or more Vault files comes in two flavors, FileManager.AcquireFiles() and FileManager.AcqurieFilesAsync(). As the name implies, the first is a synchronous download call while the second is an asynchronous call that will return immediately with a System.Threading.Tasks.Task that you can use to schedule a continuation on. The GUI versions of the acquire files methods are similarly named AcquireFiles() and AcquireFilesAsync() but instead are accessed off the VDF.Vault.Forms.Library class. As with the non-GUI method, the async GUI version will return control to the calling method almost immediately and returns a Task of the actual acquire work. The GUI methods will, by default, display a progress dialog to the user during the download. The progress dialog will be modeless if the async version was used and will be a modal dialog, otherwise.

All of these different acquire methods accept some form of a settings object to control various aspects of the acquire workflow. The non-GUI methods accept the VDF.Vault.Settings.AcquireFilesSettings class as a parameter. This class is used as the base class for all different flavors of the download settings. The GUI versions of the acquire files methods accept two different versions settings classes that have the AcquireFilesSettings class as a base class. These are the VDF.Vault.Forms.Settings.ProgressAcquireFilesSettings class and the VDF.Vault.Forms.Settings.InteractiveAcquireFilesSettings class. Either of these settings classes can be passed into the GUI acquire file methods. If client applications use the ProgressAcquireFilesSettings, then the user will only see a progress dialog during a file download. If an instance of InteractiveAcquireFilesSettings is instead passed into the GUI acquire files methods, the VDF will display a "get/checkout" dialog to the user before attempting to download files. Using this dialog, the user can modify some of the download settings before the download begins, such as specifying whether to checkout certain files or change the download location.

Client applications will largely use all the different acquire files settings classes in the same way. The general process of setting up the acquire files settings typically has just two steps. First, simply create a new instance of the settings class. The setting's constructors takes a VDF connection, and this connection must be the connection to the Vault that the client app is trying to download files from. Second, add the files you want to acquire (aka-download) to the settings instance using the AcquireFilesSettings.AddEntityToAcquire() method. Of course, there are several other settings and extensibility points that can be tweaked. More details on the other setting's properties can be found in the SDK documentation. Once the settings are complete, call the appropriate AcquireFiles[Async]() method and pass in the settings as a parameter. An example of an acquire workflow using the VDF can be seen in the "VaultBrowserSample" sample app that comes packaged with the SDK.

## Moving from the 2013 SDK Download API to the 2014 Download API

For developers who are most interested in performing a direct port from the 2013 SDK to the 2014 SDK, they will likely focus on using the non-GUI, synchronous download method, FileManager.AcquireFiles(). This is because the previous versions of SDK didn't provide any GUI or asynchronous components or methods and so it is likely that the client applications to be updated will already have some sort of existing GUI or code to which files to download and/or checkout. Most 2013 applications probably downloaded files from the Vault using the DocumentService's DownloadFile() method. This method simply pulls down the bytes for a given file in Vault. Some code using it might look something like this:

![](../images/screenshot-vdf-downloadmethod1.png)

The code above downloads the bytes for a given file from Vault and writes them to disk at a certain location. Some code that uses the VDF to accomplish the same goal would likely look something like this:

#### Working with VDF Currency

# Working with VDF Currency

The VDF DLLs use a set of currency classes that live in the VDF.Vault.Currency namespace, while the web services API still uses the currency classes in the Autodesk.Connectivity.WebServices namespace.

Because the VDF only implements some Vault workflows and not all, client applications will often have to use the web service API for features that aren't supplied by the VDF. This means that these applications will need to occasionally convert between the two forms of currency classes.

As you can see in the sample code below, to convert from a file proxy class to the VDF file currency, client apps just have to construct a new VDF file currency object using the connection to the Vault that the file came from and the file proxy instance. This is the typical pattern for how to convert to almost all of the VDF currency classes. Converting from the VDF currency classes back to web service proxy classes is even simpler because only an implicit cast is required.

## Sample Code

The sample code in the [Downloading Files with the VDF](GUID-C711E51B-B069-4A80-8611-0A6FC8B5FA13.htm) section demonstrates how to handle an issue that is likely to occur for applications that work with both the VDF and the web services API. On the line that is copied below, the code sample is converting between web service currency (server proxy classes) and VDF currency.

## Data Standard API Reference

# Data Standard API Reference

Data Standard provides objects that can be used in XAML-files and in PowerShell code, to interact with the Data Standard Add-Ins.

More complex objects even allow you to use Vault API functions directly in PowerShell code.

### PowerShell Functions for Data Standard

# PowerShell Functions for Data Standard

PowerShell functions are used to programmatically customize business logic, behavior, default values, and the user interface.

Data Standard comes with several functions that are required to work with the standard dialogs and tabs. Some functions are called from inside the Data Standard Add-Ins.

**These functions are mandatory and should not be removed.**

The functions can be regarded as event driven functions and can be modified to change the behavior. Other functions are called directly from the XAML file. For example, to retrieve information from the Vault database (e.g.,-available-numbering-schemes,-categories).

All \*.ps1 and \*.psm1(powershell-module) files that are located in the "addinVault" (Vault) or "addins" (CAD) folders are automatically imported and used.

Note: Autodesk recommends using a separate .ps1 file for your own functions.

The following chart contains a list of the functions that are directly called either from an Add-In or from a XAML file. For better readability of the code, these functions may call other functions. These other functions, are not explicitly listed.

| Function | File | Usage Add-in | Usage XAML | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ActivateOKButton | Vault: Default.ps1 | Vault |  | Used for validation and enabling the OK button in edit and create dialogs. By default it calls the function Validate() which then, based on the window type, calls further validation functions.  Because ActivateOkButton is called every time data is changed on the dialog, this can cause performance problems if the validation functions are too complex. |
| AddinLoaded | CAD: Default.ps1 | CAD |  | Called when the VDS Inventor- or AutoCAD-Addin is loaded. |
| Addinunloaded | CAD: Default.ps1 | CAD |  | Called when the VDS Inventor- or AutoCAD-Addin is unloaded. |
| GetCategories | Vault,  CAD: Default.ps1 |  | Vault, CAD | This function is used in the create dialogs for Vault and CAD to show categories in a combo box.  The default implementation returns a list of all file, folder, or custom entity categories based on the window name. Used for Dynamic Properties. For CAD edit dialogs, the assigned category is returned. |
| GetNewCustomObjectName | Vault: Default.ps1 | Vault |  | Called when clicking the OK button in a create custom object dialog. This function returns the name of the new custom object. The default implementation either gets the value from a create dialog control with the name CUSTOMOBJECTNAME or from a special property \_GeneratedNumber if Vault numbering schemes are defined. See Data Standard and Numbering Schemes for more information. |
| GetNewFileName | Vault: Default.ps1 | Vault |  | Called when clicking the OK button in a create file dialog. This function returns the filename of the new file. The default implementation either gets the value from a create dialog control with the name FILENAME or from a special property \_GeneratedNumber if Vault numbering schemes are defined. See Data Standard and Numbering Schemes for more information. |
| GetNewFolderName | Vault: Default.ps1 | Vault |  | Called when clicking the OK button in a create folder dialog. This function returns the name of the new folder. The default implementation either gets the value from a create dialog control with the name FOLDERNAME or from a special property \_GeneratedNumber if Vault numbering schemes are defined. See Data Standard and Numbering Schemes for more information. |
| GetNumSchms | Vault,  CAD: Default.ps1 |  | Vault, CAD | This function is used in file create dialogs for Vault and CAD to show numbering schemes in a combo box. The default implementation returns all activated Vault file numbering schemes. The default numbering scheme is a scheme with the same name as the selected category. If a scheme does not exist with the same name as the selected category, the scheme is the default scheme set in the Vault settings. |
| GetParentFolderName | Vault: Default.ps1 | Vault |  | Called when clicking the OK button in a create folder dialog. This function can be used to force a specific folder name when using New Standard File or New Standard Folder functions. If an empty string is returned the selected folder is used. |
| [InitializeTabWindow](InitializeTabWindow-Function-for.htm) | Vault: Default.ps1 | Vault |  | Called when initializing Data Standard tabs in Vault. |
| [InitializeWindow](InitializeWindow-Function-for.htm) | Vault: Default.ps1 | Vault |  | Called when initializing Data Standard dialogs. |
| ItemTitle | Vault: Default.ps1 |  | Vault | Used in tabs for Item and ECO objects. The default implementation returns the value of the item or ECO "Title (item,CO)" property.  Note:  {Binding Prop[\_XLTN\_TITLE\_ITEM\_CO]} cannot be used directly in the XAML because of the property name. |
| ItemDescription | Vault: Default.ps1 |  | Vault | Used in tabs for Item and ECO objects. The default implementation returns the value of the item or ECO "Description (item,CO)" property.  Note:  {Binding Prop[\_XLTN\_DESCRIPTION\_ITEM\_CO]} cannot be used directly in the XAML because of the property name. |
| OnLogOn | Vault: Default.ps1 | Vault |  | Called when a user logs into a vault. |
| OnLogOff | Vault: Default.ps1 |  | Vault | Called when the user logs off. |
| [OnPostCloseDialog](OnPostCloseDialog-Function-for.htm) | CAD: Default.ps1 | CAD |  | Called when the Data Standard dialogs is closed by clicking the OK button, and before the filename is set the properties are updated. |
| [OnTabContextChanged](OnTabContextChanged-Function-for.htm) | Vault: Default.ps1 | Vault |  | Called when the context of a custom tab in Vault changes. Is used to update the data that is shown in the tab. |
| SetWindowTitle($newFile, $editFile, $name) | Vault, CAD: Default.ps1 | Vault, CAD |  | Called from InitializeWindow function. This function is fed with inputs depending on CreateMode or EditMode as well as whether it is for File, Folder or CustomObject. The output that is returned is set as the title of the Dialog. |

Note: The ps1-files for the menu items, located in C:\ProgramData\Autodesk\\Extensions\DataStandard\Vault\addinVault\Menus, contain code which is not in the scope of a PowerShell function. This code is executed directly when the menu item is clicked.

#### InitializeTabWindow Function for Data Standard

# InitializeTabWindow Function for Data Standard

The `InitializeTabWindow` function is executed whenever the context of a custom tab in Vault changes. The function is used to adjust the content of a custom tab for the different XAML files.

## Usage

Called from the Vault-AddIn. The function is mandatory and cannot be removed.

A default implementation is available in:

* C:\ProgramData\Autodesk\\Extensions\DataStandard\Vault\addinVault\Default.ps1

## Example

```
function OnTabContextChanged
{
    $xamlFile = [System.IO.Path]::GetFileName($vaultcontext.usercontrol.xamlfile)
    if ($vaultcontext.selectedobject.typeid.selectioncontext--eq-"filemaster"--and-$xamlfile--eq-"cad-bom.xaml")
    {
        $filemasterid = $vaultContext.SelectedObject.Id
        $file = $vault.DocumentService.GetLatestFileByMasterId($filemasterid)
        $bom = @(getfilebom($file.id))
        $dsWindow.FindName("bomlist").ItemsSource = $bom
    }
    if ($vaultcontext.selectedobject.typeid.selectioncontext--eq-"itemmaster"--and-$xamlfile--eq-"associated-files.xaml")
    {
        $items = $vault.ItemService.GetItemsByIds(@($vaultContext.SelectedObject.Id))
        $item = $items[0]
        $itemids = @($item.id)
        $assocFiles = @(GetAssociatedFiles $itemids $([System.IO.Path]::GetDirectoryName($vaultcontext.usercontrol.xamlfile)))
        $dsWindow.FindName("assoicatedfiles").ItemsSource = $assocFiles
    }
}
```

**Parent page:** [PowerShell Functions for Data Standard](GUID-92E898FB-638A-4D00-AF9B-08C74F878987.htm)


#### InitializeWindow Function for Data Standard

# InitializeWindow Function for Data Standard

The `InitializeWindow` function is executed before a DataStandard window opens. In this function, variables can be predefined, events can be subscribed, or the window appearance can be customized.

## Usage

Called from the Vault client and Inventor and AutoCAD add-ins. The function is mandatory and cannot be removed.

A default implementation is available in:

* C:\ProgramData\Autodesk\\Extensions\DataStandard\Vault\addinVault\Default.ps1
* C:\ProgramData\Autodesk\\Extensions\DataStandard\CAD\addins\Default.ps1

## Example

```
 function InitializeWindow
{
    # define the windows size
    $dsWindow.Width = 500
    $dsWindow.Height = 600
  
    # subscribe to the "Click" event of the OK button
    $dsWindow.FindName("buttonok").add_Click(
    {
        [System.Windows.Forms.MessageBox]::Show("ok-button-clicked")
    })
}
```

#### OnPostCloseDialog Function for Data Standard

# OnPostCloseDialog Function for Data Standard

For Inventor and AutoCAD, the `OnPostCloseDialog` function is called when clicking "OK" in a dialog, before the file name is set and the iProperties update.

This timing allows the code to still modify properties before the file is saved. This could be useful when users are not required to select a numbering scheme (see-sample-"use-vault-numbering-without-showing-the-number-scheme-control-in-the-dialog"-for-cad-in-example–using-numbering-schemes-in-data-standard.

In the default implementation the function doesn't do anything.

## Usage

Called from the Inventor and AutoCAD Add-ins. The function is mandatory and cannot be removed.

A default implementation is available in:

* C:\ProgramData\Autodesk\\Extensions\DataStandard\CAD\addins\Default.ps1

Additionally, the variable `$dsWindow.Name` contains the dialog name. By default that is either `InventorWindow` or `AutoCADWindow`.

These variables can be used to provide different implementations for different scenarios.

#### $dsWindow Variable for Data Standard

# $dsWindow Variable for Data Standard

The `$dsWindow` variable can be used to access the ViewModel of a dialog or custom tabs.

Type

* Type in the context of Dialogs: [System.Windows.Window](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.window(v=vs.100).aspx)
* Type in the context of Custom Tabs: [System.Windows.Controls.UserControl](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.windows.controls.usercontrol(v=vs.110).aspx)

## Accessing the ViewModel of a Dialog

The data ViewModel of a dialog can be accessed by the DataContext member of $dsWindow. Since the DataContext isn't initialized by the time the InitializeWindow functions is called, the event DataContextChanged can be used to retrieve the ViewModel.

**Example**

```
function InitializeWindow
{
    $dsWindow.add_DataContextChanged({
        param($sender,-$eventargs)
        $viewModel = $dsWindow.DataContext
    })
}
```

## ViewModel Types

MainViewModel

Valid for: Data Standard for Vault, Data Standard for AutoCAD

Available Collections:

* + No Collections available, since the view contains only a single document.

CableAndHarnessViewModel

#### $Prop[] Variable in Data Standard

# $Prop[] Variable in Data Standard

The `$Prop[]` variable provides access to Vault properties when used in Data Standard for Vault, or CAD properties when used in Data Standard for CAD. Specifying the property name in the square brackets [] returns an `IProperty` object which can be used for getting and setting property values.

\*\*Type:\*\*Common.Wpf.IndexerForwarder, IProperty

## Special Properties

For regular properties, the name of the property has to be used.

But there are special read-only properties that allow to access additional information through the `$Prop` variable. These properties have an underscore prefix (-).

Note: The availability column indicates in which PowerShell files the objects can be used. For example, **Vault file dialog** means, the PowerShell code is used in the context of a create and edit file dialog.

| Special Property | Availability | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| -Category | Vault: File, Folder, Custom Object  AutoCAD, Inventor | Type of value: string  Is set to the assigned category for an existing Vault object. |
| -CreateMode | Vault: File, Folder, Custom Object  AutoCAD, Inventor | Type of Value: bool  Can be used in PowerShell functions to determine if the Data Standard window is in create mode. This is the case when a file gets saved for the first time. |
| -CopyMode | Inventor, AutoCAD | Type of value: bool  Can be used in PowerShell functions to determine if Data Standard window is in copy mode. Set to true for the Data Standard functions Copy and Replace with Copy.    Note: When -CopyMode is true, -CreateMode is also set to true. |
| -EditMode | Vault: File, Folder, Custom Object  AutoCAD, Inventor | Type of value: bool  Can be used in PowerShell functions to determine if Data Standard window is in edit mode. Set to true for the Data Standard function: Datasheet. |
| -Format | Inventor | Type of value: string  Is set to the assigned format for an Inventor object or to the first element of ListValues.  Type of ListValues: List<string> Contains a list of formats which depend on the document type.   * For Drawings: PDF, DXF, DWG * For Models: JT, STEP |
| -FileExt | Vault: File  AutoCAD, Inventor | Type of value: string  Contains the file extension. |
| -FileName | Vault: File  AutoCAD, Inventor | Type of value: string  Contains the file name without the extension. |
| -FilePath | Vault: File  AutoCAd, Inventor | Type of value: string  Contains the Vault file path (starting with $) without the file name. |
| -FolderName | Vault: Folder | Type of value: string  Contains the folder name. |
| -FolderPath | Vault: Folder | Type of value: string  Contains the Vault folder path (starting with $) without the file name. |
| -GeneratedNumber | Vault: File | Type of value: string  Contains the generated number. The value is set by the DSNumSchemeCtrl. See Numbering for more information. |
| -OriginalFileName | AutoCAD, Inventor | Type of value: string  Contains the source document's name during a Copy or Copy Include Drawing event. |
| -SaveCopyAsMode | Inventor | Type of value: bool  Value is set to true when an Inventor user clicks the Save Copy As button, otherwise value is false. |
| -SuggestedVaultPath | Inventor | Type of value: string  Contains the path of the directly related file, for example, the path of the parent assembly for components created in the assembly context, or the path of the main component view in the drawings. |
| -VaultVirtualPath | Inventor | Type of value: string  Contains the mapped virtual folder for Vault as defined in the Inventor project file. |
| -WorkspacePath | Inventor | Type of value: string  Contains the workspace path as defined in the Inventor project file. |

## Localization

When the property name in the square brackets [] starts with the prefix `-XLTN-` (e.g., `$prop["-XLTN-TITLE-ITEM-CO"].Value`), the name is mapped to the real property name of the localized Vault server version. See Localization for more information.

## Object `IProperty`

The `IProperty` object is a wrapper for the underlying Vault or CAD property.

Note: The expression `$prop["Title"]` just returns an `IProperty` object for the property "Title." It does not return the direct value of the property.

Properties

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Value | object | Returns the value of the property. Can be used to get or set the property value. |
| IsValid | bool | Checks if the property is valid |
| IsInvalid | bool | Negation of IsValid. Useful because it is not easy to negate values in XAML. |
| ListValues | Object  Array | Only used for the special property "-Category." Returns a list of strings. |
| EnforceListValues | bool | Gets the existing value if any or can be set to override it. |
| IsObligatory | bool | Gets the existing value if any or can be set to override it. |
| Minimum Length | int | Gets the existing value if any or can be set to override it. |
| MaximumLength | int | Gets the existing value if any or can be set to override it. |
| Case | string | Gets the existing value if any or can be set to override it. |
| MinimumDate | DateTime | Gets the existing value if any or can be set to override it. |
| MaximumDate | DateTime | Gets the existing value if any or can be set to override it. |
| MinimumValue | int | Gets the existing value if any or can be set to override it. |
| MaximumValue | int | Gets the existing value if any or can be set to override it. |
| CustomValidation | ScriptBlock | Executes scriptblock and returns the result. The script block should return a bool value. When this is set, then all the other constraints are not executed. |
| CustomValidationErrorMessage | string | When the above CustomValidation returns false, any text set here will appear as tooltip on the control that this Prop object is bound to. |

Events

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| PropertyChanged | Occurs when a property value changes. See Example-Using Events with the Data Standard Dialog for an example. |

## Examples

In PowerShell, properties can be accessed with the following syntax:

**PowerShell**

```
$fileName = $Prop["-FileName"].Value
```

The same object can be accessed through a [XAML binding](GUID-F37FCEBB-BE65-4591-874E-3DA7691B6023.htm). However the syntax is slightly different:

**XAML**

```
<TextBox Text="{Binding Prop[-FileName].Value}"/>
```

## Enterprise Add-on for Autodesk Vault

# Enterprise Add-on for Autodesk Vault

Accelerate your return on investment in data management solutions with the Enterprise Add-On for Autodesk® Vault.

This set of proven components - developed, supported, and maintained by Autodesk Consulting - simplifies implementation and usage of Autodesk Vault software.

Administrators and users save time, boost productivity, and optimize data management outcomes, realizing the value of Autodesk Vault more quickly.

## Get the Enterprise Add-on for Autodesk Vault

The Enterprise Add-On for Autodesk Vault can be purchased directly from Autodesk.

Contact your Autodesk Consulting or Autodesk Sales representative for details.

## Enterprise Add-on for Vault Functionality Overview

The Enterprise Add-On for Autodesk Vault is a set of productivity tools that are integrated with Vault. It provides following functionality:

## Property Management

A file property in Vault is the information about a document stored in vault. The file properties are visible and accessible only inside the Vault. You can create your own user-defined properties in Vault.

The properties of a file (stored-on-file-level) exist independently of Vault (for example, iProperty for Inventor files or properties of a doc-file) and can be mapped to Vault file properties.

The property management is used to edit properties on file level. The main purpose of the property management is to provide an easy way for a CAD manager to provide property templates where users can enter document properties prior adding documents to the Vault.

It consists of two parts: Synchronize and Edit Properties.

**Synchronize**

* Inventor Add-in.
* Works for drawings only.
* Copies designated properties automatically from model document to the drawing.
* Based on definitions uploaded to the Vault to which the user is connected.

**Edit Properties**

* Inventor Add-in
* Provides an interface in Inventor to edit Vault Properties with (from-inventor).

According the configuration it is possible to validate properties against selected schema. A dialog box displays in case of error.

Note: There is no way to force a dialog box on every save.

## Publish Jobs

The standard functionality of Vault is to publish a visualization file (for example, a \*.dwf file) using the job server. The table below lists various input and output file formats for the various publishers available in Vault add-on.

| *Autodesk Product* | *Input File Format* | *Output File Format* | *Publisher Type* |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AutoCAD AutoCAD Core Console | dwg | pdf | PDF AutoCAD PDF AutoCADMultiLayout |
| dxf | dwf | AutoCAD DXF to DWF |
| Inventor Inventor Server \*(ipn-input-file-format-and-dwf-output-format-not-supported-by-inventor-server-publisher) | idw, dwg, ipn\* | pdf | PDF Inventor |
| ipt, iam | stp | STEP Inventor |
| ipt, iam | igs | IGES Inventor |
| ipt, iam | jt | JT Inventor |
| ipt, iam | stl | STL Inventor |
| idw, dwg | dwg | DWG Inventor |
| idw, dwg | dxf | DXF Inventor |
| idw, dwg | dwf\* | DWF Inventor |
| ipt | CATPart | CATIA V5 Part Inventor |
| iam | CATProduct | CATIA V5 Product Inventor |
| ipt | dxf | Flat Pattern DXF Inventor |
| Microsoft Office | doc, docx | pdf | Office World Publisher |
| xls, xlsx | pdf | Office Excel Publisher |
| ppt, pptx | pdf | Office PowerPoint Publisher |
| Navisworks | nwc, nwd, nwf | dwf | Navisworks |

The creation can be triggered manually or through a state change. You have some options concerning the resulting files:

* Resulting file name patterns can use Vault - properties.
* Resulting files can be attached to the original file.
* Resulting files can be dropped in a specific folder.

## Clone Structure

While in the standard functionality of Vault you can only move folders in Vault and no copy is possible. This functionality offers you a way to copy folder structures in Vault.

With the Clone Structure functionality:

* Select a folder and copy it.
* You can define new folder name, new folder location, and other options.
* Properties and Permissions can be considered as well.

## Email Notification

The email Notification in the standard Vault is related to ECOs and ERP. This VAO functionality allows a specified action (such-as-a-state-change) to serve as a trigger event that automatically sends an email to Vault users.

Generally we have two options:

* Recipient of email is the user which executed the last state change
* Recipient of email is selected from a list

Further user interaction (for-example,-confirmation-of-the-email) is only needed when selecting the users from a list. In other cases, there is no User interaction necessary.

## Object Classification

Editing properties can be time-consuming, especially when editing many different properties.

This functionality can be used for visually joining together properties which have to be edited or reviewed. Therefore the edition or reviewing is faster and more secure.

The user can see a new tab in the Vault preview pane, where he can select the schema, which defines the properties that are shown.

This functionality is suitable for items and documents, once an item or document is selected.

## Four Eyes Check

This functionality is used for supporting security measures (another-user-than-originator-must-check-/-approve).

The check is applied during a state change on a document. It contains a control whether the current user is the same user who has executed the previous state change. It contains two parts: Pre-check and User Check.

**Precheck**

* The state change must be defined (lifecycle-name-including-from-state-and-to-state)
* The pre-check contains several conditions at two different levels
* Level of the selected document (file-extension-and-property-condition)
* Level of the related documents (file-extension-and-property-condition).

  Note: Only first-level documents are considered.

Please have a look at the flow chart to determine the circumstances which have to be met by the Pre Check in order to be successful.

**User Check**

* After a successful Pre Check the User Check will be done.
* Current User will be compared with the previous User
* Previous User: the user who has changed the previous state to the current state

The state change will be canceled when Current User and Previous User are equal. In other words: The two users must be different.

If the Precheck was not successful, the user check won´t be executed, and therefore the state change won´t be canceled under any circumstances.

Basically, as a default, there is no check - or the check defaults to true.
